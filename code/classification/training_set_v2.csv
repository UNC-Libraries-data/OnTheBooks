S$ 2 Authority to Make Special Assessments. The board of commissioners of any county may specially assess all, or part, of the cost of any beach erosion control or flood and hurricane protection works against the property to be benefited by such works. Provided, that no property lying within the corporate limits of any municipality shall be subject to assessment unless the governing body of the municipality has by resolution given its approval prior to the undertaking of any proposed works. Provided, further, that the total special assessment levied against any lot or tract of land under the authority of this Article shall not exceed the sum which would be due under an ad valorem tax of ten cents (10) (the valuation to be that of said lot or tract of land without improvements as of the time of the making of the special assessment) if such an ad valorem 980 tax were levied annually for the period of years during which said special assessment is authorized to be paid in installments in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of this Article. Provided, further, the authority herein granted shall apply only to those counties which are in part, or in whole, bounded by the Atlantic Ocean.  3 Basis for Making Assessments. Assessments may be made on the basis of: -1 The frontage of land abutting on any beach erosion con.rol or flood and hurricane protection works, at an equal rate per foot of frontage, or -2 The frontage of land abutting on a beach or shore line which is protected or benefited by any beach erosion control or flood and hurricane protection works, at an equal rate per foot frontage, or -3 The acreage of land benefited by any beach erosion control or flood and hurricane protection works, at an equal rate per acre of land, or -4 The valuation of land benefited by any beach erosion control or flood and hurricane protection works, the valuation to be based upon the value of the land without improvements as shown on the tax assessments records of the county, at an equal rate per dollar of valuation, or -5 A combination of two or more of these bases. Whenever the basis selected for assessment is either acreage or the value of land, the board of commissioners may provide for the laying out of benefit zones according to the distance from the shore line, the distance from the beach erosion control or flood and hurricane protection works, the elevation of the land, or other relevant factors, and establish differing rates of assessment to apply uniformly throughout each benefit zone.  4 Preliminary Resolution to Be Adopted; Contents. Whenever the board of commissioners of any county determines to undertake any beach erosion control or flood and hurricane protection works and assess all, or part, of the cost thereof, the board shall first adopt a preliminary resolution setting forth its intention and describing the nature of the project, or projects, and the proposed terms and conditions by which it is to be undertaken.

The board of commissioners shall cause a copy of the preliminary resolution to be published in a newspaper having general circulation in the county at least ten days prior to the date set for the public hearing on the proposed project or projects. In addition, the board of commissioners shall cause a copy of the preliminary resolution, containing the order for the public hearing, to be mailed to the owners of all property subject to assessment if the project, or projects, should be undertaken. The mailing of copies of the preliminary resolution shall be to the owners of that property as shown on the tax records of the county, and shall take place at least ten days prior to the date set for the public hearing on the preliminary resolution. The person designated to mail these resolutions shall file a certificate with the board of commissioners that such resolutions were mailed, the certificate to include the date of mailing. Such certificates shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud.  6 Hearing on Preliminary Resolution; Resolution Directing Undertaking of Works. At the time and place set for the public hearing, the board of commissioners shall hear all interested persons who appear with respect to any matter covered by the preliminary resolution. After the public hearing, if the board of commissioners so determines, the board may adopt a resolution directing that the project, or projects, covered by the preliminary resolution, or part of them be undertaken. This resolution shall describe the project, or projects, to be undertaken in general terms (which may be by reference to projects described in the preliminary resolution) and shall set forth the following: -1 The basis on which the special assessments shall be levied which shall include a general description of the boundaries of the area benefited if the basis of assessment is either acreage or value of land; -2 The percentage of the cost to be specially assessed; -3 The terms of payment, including the conditions under which assessments are to be held in abeyance, if any.

Upon completion of the project, or projects, the board of commissioners shall ascertain the total cost. In addition to the cost of construction, there may be included therein the cost of all necessary legal service, the amount of interest paid during construction, costs of rights of way, and the costs of publication of notices and resolutions.

Upon determination of the total cost of any assessment project, the board of commissioners shall cause to be prepared a preliminary assessment roll, on which shall be entered a brief description of each lot, parcel, or tract of land assessed, the basis for the assessment, the amount assessed against each, the terms of payment, and the name or names of the owners of each parcel of land as far as the same can be ascertained; provided, that a map of the project on which is shown each parcel assessed and the basis for its assessment, together with the amount assessed against each such parcel and the name or names of the owner or owners, as far as the same can be ascertained, shall be a sufficient assessment roll. After the preliminary assessment roll has been completed, it shall be filed in the office of the clerk to the board of commissioners where it shall be available for inspection. A notice of the completion of the assessment roll, setting forth in general terms a description of the project, noting the availability of the assessment roll in the office of the clerk for inspection, and stating the time and place for a hearing before the board of commissioners on the preliminary assessment roll, shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation in the county at least ten days prior to the date set for the hearing on the preliminary assessment roll. In addition, the board of commissioners shall cause a notice of the hearing on the preliminary assessment roll to be mailed to the owners of property, as shown on the tax records of the county, listed on the preliminary assessment roll at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing.

The person designated to mail these notices shall file a certificate with the board of commissioners that such notices were mailed, the certificate to include the date of mailing. Such certificates shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud. $ 9 Hearing on Preliminary Assessment Rolls; Revision, Confirmation; Lien. At the time set for the public hearing, or at some other time to which the public hearing may be adjourned, the board of commissioners shall hear objections to the preliminary assessment roll from all persons interested who appear. Then, or thereafter, the board of commissioners shall either annul, or modify, or confirm, in whole or in part, the assessments, either by confirming the preliminary assessments against any or all of the lots or parcels described in the preliminary assessment roll, or by canceling, increasing, or reducing the same as is determined to be proper in accordance with the basis for the assessment. If any property is omitted from the preliminary assessment roll, the board of commissioners may place it on the roll and levy the proper assessment. Whenever the board of commissioners shall confirm assessments for any project, the clerk to the board shall enter on the minutes of the board and on the assessment roll the date, hour, and minute of conformation, and from the time of confirmation the assessments shall be a lien on the property assessed of the 983 same nature and to the same extent as county and city taxes and shall be superior to all other liens and encumbrances, After the assessment roll is confirmed a copy of the same shall be delivered to the county tax collector for collection in the same manner as taxes, except as herein provided. $ 10 Publication of Notice of Confirmation of Assessment Roll. After the expiration of twenty days from the confirmation of the assessment roll, the county tax collector shall cause to be published once in a newspaper having general circulation in the county a notice of confirmation of the assessment roll, and that assessments may be paid at any time before the expiration of thirty days from the date of the publication of the notice without interest, but if not paid within this time, all installments thereof shall bear interest at the rate of six per centum -6% per annum from the date of the confirmation of the assessment roll.  11 Appeal to Superior Court. If the owner of, or any person interested in, any lot or parcel of land against which an assessment is made is dissatisfied with the amount of the assessment, he may, within ten days after the confirmation of the assessment roll, file with the board of commissioners and the court a written notice that he takes an appeal to the Superior Court of the county, in which case he shall within twenty days after the confirmation of the assessment roll serve on the chairman of the board of commissioners or the clerk to the board of commissioners a statement of facts upon which he bases his appeal. The appeal shall be tried as other actions at law. S$ 12 Reassessment. The board of commissioners shall have the power, when in its judgment there is any irregularity, omission, error or lack of jurisdiction in any of the proceedings relating thereto, to set aside the whole of any special assessment made by it, and thereupon to make a reassessment. In such case there shall be included, as a part of the cost of the project, all additional interest paid, or to be paid, as a result of the delay in confirming the assessment. The proceeding shall, as far as practicable, be in all respects as in the case of original assessments, and the reassessment shall have the same force as if it had originally been properly made. $ 13 Payment of Assessment in Cash or by Installments. The owner or owners of any property assessed shall have the option, within thirty days following the publication of the notice of the confirmation of the assessment roll, of paying the assessment in cash or of paying in not less than two and not more than ten annual installments, as may have been provided by the board of commissioners in the resolution directing the undertaking of the project giving rise to the assessment. With respect to payment by installment, the board of commissioners may provide -1 that the first installment with interest shall become due and payable on the date when property taxes are due and payable and one subsequent installment and interest shall be due and payable on the same date in each successive year until the assessment is paid in full, or -2 that the first installment with interest shall become due and payable sixty days after the date of the confirmation of the assessment roll, and one subsequent in- 984 stallment and interest shall be due and payable on the same day of the month in each successive year until the assessment is paid in full. $ 14 Enforcement of Payment of Assessments. No statute of limitations shall bar the right of the county to enforce any remedy provided by law for the collection of unpaid assessments, save from and after ten years from default in the payment thereof, or if payable in installments, ten years from the default in the payment of any installments. Such assessments shall bear interest at the rate of six per centum -6% per annum only. Upon the failure of any property owner to pay any installment when due and payable, all of the installments remaining unpaid shall immediately become due and payable, and property and rights of way may be sold by the county under the same rules and regulations (except that the sale of liens shall not be required) rights of redemption and savings as are now prescribed by law for the sale of land for unpaid taxes. Provided, after the default in the payment of any installment of an assessment, the board of commissioners may, on the payment of all installments in arrears, together with interest due thereon and on reimbursement of any expense incurred in attempting to obtain payment, reinstate the remaining unpaid installments of such assessment so that they shall become due in the same manner as they would have if there had been no default, and such extension may be granted at any time prior to the institution of an action to foreclose.  15 Assessments in Case of Tenant for Life or Years; Apportionment of Assessments. The following provisions of the General Statutes concerning municipal special assessments, as they now exist and as they may be amended, with modifications as specified, shall apply to beach erosion control or flood and hurricane protection assessments levied by counties: G. S. 160-95 to 160-97, which relate to assessments in case of tenants for life or years; G. S. 160-98, which relates to liens in favor of co-tenants or joint tenants paying assessments; G. S. 160-191, which relates to apportionment of assessments where property has been or is subject to be subdivided (except that for governing board, read board of commissioners). $ 16 Authority to Hold Assessments in Abeyance. The board of commissioners of any county may, by resolution, provide that assessments levied as authorized in this Article to be held in abeyance without the payment of interest for any benefited property assessed. In providing for the holding of assessments in abeyance, the board of commissioners shall classify the property assessed according to general land use or other relevant factors, and shall provide that the period of abeyance be the same for all assessed property in any classification. Provided, said resolution may not provide for the holding in abeyance of any assessment for more than ten years. Any assessment held in abeyance shall, upon the termination of the period of abeyance, be paid in accordance with the terms set out in the confirming resolution. 985 All applicable statutes of limitations are hereby suspended during the time that any assessment is held in abeyance without the payment of interest, as provided in this Section. Such time shall not be a part of the time limited for commencement of action for the enforcement of payment of any such assessment, and such action may be brought at any time within ten years from the date of the termination of the period of abeyance."

WHEREAS, in the Diamond Industry, the maintenance of fair com- petitive conditions is essential and in the interest of protecting industry, trade and the public; and WHEREAS, any act or practice which fixes or controls prices through combination or agreement, or which unreasonably restrains trade or sup- 522 presses competition, or otherwise unlawfully injures, destroys or prevents competition, and any unfair trade practice is against public policy: Now, therefore, The General Assembly of North Carolina do enact:","It is an Unfair Trade Practice for any member of the Diamond Industry: (a) To use, or cause or promote the use of, any trade promotional literature, advertising matter, guarantee, warranty, mark, brand, label, trade name, picture, design or device, designation, or other type of oral or written representation, however disseminated or published, which has the capacity and tendency or effect of misleading or deceiving purchasers or prospective purchasers with respect to the type, kind, grade, quality, color, cut, quantity, size, weight, nature, substance, durability, serviceability, origin, preparation, production, manufacture, distribution, or customary or regular price, of any diamond or other product of the industry, or which has the capacity and tendency or effect of misleading or deceiving the purchasing or consuming public in any other material respect. (b) In the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of products of the industry to use the unqualified word diamond as descriptive of or as an identification for any object or product not meeting the requirements specified in the definition of diamond hereinabove set forth, or which, though meeting such requirements, has not been symmetrically fashioned with at least seventeen -17 polished facets. The foregoing provisions of subsection (b) have application to the unqualified use of the word diamond. They are not to be construed as inhibiting: 523 1 The use of the words rough diamond as descriptive of or as a designation for, uncut or unfaceted objects or products meeting the requirements specified in the mentioned definition of diamond; or 2 The use of the word diamond as descriptive of or as a designation for objects or products meeting the requirements of said definition of diamond, but which have not been symmetrically fashioned with at least seventeen -17 polished facets when in immediate conjunction with the word diamond, there is either a disclosure of the number of facets and shape of the diamond or the name of a type of diamond which denotes shape and which usually has less than seventeen -17 facets (e.g., rose diamond); or 8 The use of the words imitation diamond as descriptive of or as a designation for objects or products which do not meet the requirements of said definition of diamond but have an appearance similar to that of a cut and polished diamond. When the word diamond is so used, the qualifying word or words shall be of at least equal conspicuousness as the word diamond. (c) To use the words reproduction, replica, diamond-like, or similar terms as descriptive of imitation diamonds. (d) To use the term synthetic diamond as descriptive of any object or product unless such object or product has in fact been artificially created and is of similar appearance and of essentially the same optical and physical properties and chemical structure as a diamond, or to apply the term diamond to any such man-made object or products unless it is immediately preceded in each instance with equal conspicuity by the word synthetic. (e) To use the word perfect or any other word, expression or representation of similar import, as descriptive of any diamond which discloses flaws, cracks, carbon spots, clouds, or other blemishes or imperfections of any sort when examined in normal daylight, or its equivalent, by a trained eye under a ten-power corrected diamond eye loupe or other equal magnifier. The use with respect to a stone which is not perfect of any phase (such as commercially perfect) containing the word perfect or perfectly is regarded as misleading and in violation of this subsection, and this subsection shall not be construed as approving of the use of the word perfect, or any word or representation of like import, as descriptive of any diamond that is of inferior color or make. Nothing is to be construed as inhibiting the use of the word flawless as descriptive of a diamond which meets the requirements for perfect set forth in this subsection. (f) In connection with the offering of any ring or rings or other articles of jewelry having a perfect center stone or stones, and side or supplementary stones which are not of such quality, to use the word perfect without clearly disclosing that such description applies only to the center stone or center stones. (g) To use the term blue white or any other term, expression or representation of similar import as descriptive of any diamond which 524 under normal, North daylight or its equivalent, shows any color or any trace of any color, other than blue or bluish. (h) To advertise, offer for sale, or sell any diamond which has been artificially colored or tinted by coating, irradiating, or heating, or by use of nuclear bombardment, or by any other means, without disclosure of such fact to purchasers or prospective purchasers, or without disclosure that such artificial coloring or tinting is not permanent, if such is the fact. (i) To use the terms properly cut, proper cut, modern cut, well made, or expressions of similar import, to describe any diamond that is lopsided or so thick or so thin in depth as materially to detract from the brilliance of the stone. (j) To use the unqualified expressions brilliant, or brilliant cut, or full cut to describe, identify or refer to any diamond except a round diamond which has at least thirty-two -82 facets, plus the table above the girdle and at least twenty-four -24 facets below. Such terms sheuld not be applied to single or rose-cut diamonds, either with or without qualification. They may be applied to emerald (rectangular) cut and marquise (pointed oval) cut diamonds meeting the abovestated facet requirements when, in immediate conjunction with the term used, disclosure is made of the fact that the diamond is of emerald or marquise form. (k) To use the terms clean, eye clean, commercially clean, commercially white, or any other terms, expressions, or representations of similar import in advertising, labeling, representing, or describing any diamond when such terms are used for the purpose, or with the capacity and tendency or effect, of misleading or deceiving purchasers, prospective purchasers, or the consuming public. -1 To misrepresent the weight of any diamond or to deceive purchasers or prospective purchasers as to the weight of any diamond. The standard unit for designation of the weight of a diamond is the carat, which is equivalent to two hundred milligrams (1/5 gram). While advertisements may state the approximate weight or range of weights of a group of products, all weight representations regarding individual products shall state the exact weight of the stone or stones and be accurate to within 1/200th of a carat (one-half point). (m) To state or otherwise represent the weight of all diamonds contained in a ring or other article of jewelry unless such weight figure is accompanied with equal conspicuity by the words total weight or words of similar import, so as to indicate clearly that the weight shown is that of all stones in the article and not that of the center or largest stone. (n) To use the word gem to describe, identify or refer to any diamond which does not possess the requisite beauty, brilliance, value and other qualities necessary for classification as a gem. Not all diamonds are gems. For example: Small pieces of diamond rough or melee weighing only one or two points are not to be described as gems. Neither should stones which are grossly imperfect or of decidedly poor color be so classified unless they are of such a size as to be rare and desirable and valuable for that reason. 525 No imitation diamond can be described as a gem under any circumstances. (o) In connection with the offering for sale, sale, or distribution of diamonds or articles set with diamonds, to use as part of any advertisement, label, packaging material, or other sales promotion literature, any illustration, picture, diagram or other depiction which either alone or in conjunction with accompanying words or phrases has the capacity and tendency or effect of misleading or deceiving purchasers or prospective purchasers concerning the type, kind, grade, color, cut, quality, size, weight, or character of any diamond, or which has the capacity and tendency or effect of misleading the purchasing or consuming public in any other material respect. (p) To use as part of any advertisement, label, packaging material, or other sales promotion literature, any illustration which exaggerates the size of a diamond inset or enlarges it out of proper proportion to the mounting, without clearly and conspicuously stating either the amount that the diamond has been enlarged in the illustration, or that the diamond in the illustration has been enlarged to show detail. (q) To represent, directly or indirectly, through the use of any statement or representation in advertising or through the use of any word or term in a corporate or trade name, or otherwise, that said member is a producer, cutter, or importer of diamonds, or owns or controls a cutting plant, or has connections abroad through which importations of rough or cut stones are secured, or maintains offices abroad, when such is not the fact, or in any other manner to misrepresent the character, extent, volume, or type of business being conducted. (r) To publish or circulate FALSE or misleading price quotations, price lists, terms or conditions of sale or reports as to production or sales which have the capacity and tendency or effect of misleading purchasers, prospective purchasers, or the consuming public, or to advertise, sell or offer to sell diamonds or articles set with diamonds at prices purporting to be reduced from what are, in fact, fictitious or exaggerated manufacturers or distributors suggested retail selling price, or that contains what purport to be bona fide price quotations which are in fact higher than the prices at which such products are regularly and customarily sold in bona fide retail transactions. It is likewise an unfair trade practice to distribute, sell or offer for sale to the consuming public in such manner diamonds or articles set with diamonds bearing such false, fictitious, or exaggerated price tags or labels. (s) To offer for sale, sell, advertise, describe, or otherwise represent diamonds or diamond-set merchandise as close-outs, discontinued lines, or special bargains, by use of such terms or by words or representations of similar import, when such is not TRUE in fact; or to offer for sale, sell, advertise, describe or otherwise represent such articles where the capacity and tendency or effect thereof is to lead the purchasing or consuming public to believe the same are being offered for sale or sold at greatly reduced prices, or at so-called bargain prices when such is not the fact. 526 19 (t) To advertise a particular style or type of product for sale when purchasers or prospective purchasers responding to such advertisement cannot readily purchase the advertised style or type of product from the industry member and the purpose of the advertisement is to obtain prospects for the sale of a different style or type of product than that advertised. (u) To use sale practices or methods which: 1 Deprive prospective customers of a fair opportunity to purchase any advertised style or type of product; or 2 To falsely disparage any advertised style or type or product or, without the knowledge of the customer, to substitute other styles or types of products which the advertiser intends to sell instead of the advertised style or type of product. (v) To advertise or offer for sale a grossly inadequate supply of products at reduced or bargain prices without disclosure of the inadequacy of the supply available at such prices when such advertisement or offer has the capacity and tendency or effect of misleading or deceiving purchasers or prospective purchasers. (w) To describe, identify or refer to a diamond as certified, or to use respecting it any other word or words of similar meaning or import unless: 1 The identity of the certifier and the specific matters or qualities certified are clearly disclosed in conjunction therewith; and 2 The certifier has examined such diamond, has made such certification and is qualified to certify as to such matters and qualities; and 3 There is furnished the purchaser a certificate setting forth clearly and nondeceptively the name of the certifier and the matters and qualities certified. (x) To aid, abet, coerce or induce another, directly or indirectly, to use or promote the use of any unfair trade practice specified in this Act."

Whereas in constructing the brick road from Hlizabeth City to the lower part of-Pasquotank County the road was run around by what is known as Old Weeksville; and. whereas about thirty years prior to the construction of said brick road the county took over a private road known as the Lowry Road, and in the construc- tion of the said road there is a very expensive drawbridge across what is known as New Begun Creek; that prior to any knowledge of the direction in which the brick road was going, E. R. Ferrell purchased from the Weeksville Ginning Company on the north side of New Begun Creek on the Lowry road a gin-house and wharf property, at a price of twenty-two hundred dollars; and whereas, since the construction of the brick road around by Old Weeksville, the county has abandoned the upkeep of the Lowry road and drawbridge above referred to, rendering the said prop- erty purchased by said Ferrell practically useless, leaving said property in a pocket where there is no travel nor traffic; and whereas, by reason of the construction of the brick road around by Old Weeksville, and not constructing said road in both direc- tions, it has saved the county some thirty thousand or forty thousand dollars, besides the cost of the upkeep of the expensive drawbridge in said road known as the Lowry Road, not having been paved and kept up by the county: Now, therefore, in order to partly compensate E.
