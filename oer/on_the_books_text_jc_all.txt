The county board of education shall create no new district nor shall it divide or abolish a district, nor shall it consolidate districts or parts of districts, except in accordance with a countywide plan of organization, as follows: 1 The county board of education shall present a diagram or map of the county showing the present location of each district, the position of each, the location of roads, streams and other natural barriers, the number of children in each district, the size and condition of each school building in each county. The county board of education shall then prepare a county-wide plan for the organization of all the schools of the county. This plan shall indicate the proposed changes to be made and how districts or parts of districts are proposed to be consolidated so as to work out a more advantageous school system for the entire county. 2 Before adopting the county-wide plan, the county board of education shall call a meeting of all the school committeemen and the boards of trustees and lay the proposed plan before them for their advice and suggestions. After receiving the advice of the committeemen and trustees, the county board of education shall have authority to adopt a county-wide plan of organization, and no districts or parts of any district, including non-local tax, local tax, and special charter districts, hereafter referred to in this article, shall be consolidated or the boundary lines changed, unless the consolidation or the change of boundary lines is in accordance with the adopted county-wide plan of organization: Provided, that in the event the county board of education deems it wise to modify or change the adopted plan, the board shall notify the committeemen and interested patrons and give them a hearing, if they desire to be heard, before any changes shall be made. 3 The county board of education shall have authority to execute the entire plan or any part of the same, but the county board of education shall have no authority to create a debt for the execution of any part of the proposed plan, unless authorized by law, and if the amount necessary to put into operation all or any part of said plan shall be greater than the amount that may be reasonably expected from the Operating and Equipment Fund for this purpose, the amount shall be guaranteed by the districts affected by the execution of the plan, or if the districts do not guarantee the funds the county board of education shall lay the proposed plan before the county commissioners, together with the estimated amount necessary to put the same into operation, and if the amount necessary to carry out all or any part of the proposed plan shall be approved by the county commissioners, the county board of education shall then have the authority to organize the districts in accordance with the county-wide plan. 4, When the proposed county-wide plan is adopted the county board shall notify the committeemen and boards of trustees as to what part of the plan the board proposes to carry out first and in what order the other parts of the plan will be considered, and the preference shall be given to those districts in which the needs are greatest if the funds for providing the equipment are made available. 5 In the event that any child or children of any district or any part of a district are without adequate school advantages, and these advantages may be improved by transferring said child or children to a school or schools in adjoining districts, the county board shall have authority to make such a transfer. But this shall not empower the county board of education to abolish or divide a district unless such act shall be in harmony with the county-wide plan of organization. The temporary transfer of such child or children may be made until such time as the countywide plan will provide more advantageously for them.

Persons sentenced to the penitentiary, or State Prison Department, for the first time shall be placed in the first or second class, but the assignment of a prisoner to any one of the three classes referred to in this article shall not be considered to mean that such prisoner must remain in such class, but a prisoner may be changed from a lower to a higher class or from a higher to a lower class, depending upon his behavior, and it is the purpose and intent of this section to direct the board of directors of the State Prison to encourage and assist the men to improve themselves that they can be transferred from a lower to a higher class or grade. 7725 Commutation of time. The men of the first class shall be allowed a commutation of their sentence of one hundred and four days for each year served, and the men of the second class shall be allowed a commutation of their sentence of seventy-eight days for each year they serve, and the men of the third class shall be allowed a commutation of their sentence of fifty-two days for each year they serve.

That in the event a member of such funeral or burial association, in good standing, shall die at a place so far removed from the home of such funeral or burial association that it is not deemed practicable by said association or its officers to provide a burial or funeral in services and merchandise, the said association shall cause to be paid in cash for the burial of such member the amount contracted for and stipulated in the rules, contracts or by-laws of such association not exceeding one hundred ($100.00) dollars, as provided for in said chapter, or cause such member to receive a funeral or burial equal to that agreed in such contracts, rules or by-laws of said association. (b). If the membership of any association providing benefits of one hundred ($100.00) dollars or less, in funerals or burials, as permitted by chapter seventy-one of the Public Laws of one thousand nine hundred thirty-one, shall not prove sufficient at any time to yield the benefit contracted for, then such benefits as the amount of the assessment, according to such rules and by-laws made or levied on the total assessable membership, shall be paid or provided.

There shall be at least an annual meeting of the board of directors, and such meeting shall be held immediately following the annual meeting of the membership of the association; and it shall be the duty of the board of directors, in annual meeting, to elect a president, vice-president and secretary-treasurer. The president and vice-president shall be elected from among the directors, but the secretary-treasurer may be selected from the membership, and such secretary-treasurer need not necessarily be a member of the board of directors. The secretary-treasurer shall be the only paid officer of the association, and his compensation shall be set by the board of directors. The duties of the secretary-treasurer shall be chargeable with keeping an accurate and faithful roll of the membership of this association at all times, and he shall be chargeable with the duty of faithfully preserving and applying all moneys coming into his hands by virtue of said office. The president, vice-president and secretary shall constitute a board of control who shall direct the affairs of the association in accordance with these articles and by-laws, subject to such modification as may be made by act of the General Assembly.

The president, vice-president and secretary-treasurer shall be elected for a term of from one to five years, and shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified, subject to the power of the board of directors to remove any such officer for good cause shown: Provided, that any officer removed by the board of directors shall have the right of appeal to the membership of the association, such appeal to be heard at the next ensuing meeting of said membership. Article 6 Each member shall be assessed according to the following schedule (or in multiples thereof) at the age of entry of the member: Provided, those members joining at ages under ten shall be charged with the assessment for age ten when they reach their tenth birthday: Assessment rate for age groups: Hirst ton tenth Winth da yes... cee five cents ( 5e ) Tenth to thirtieth birthday...........00.02202020.0.0002..22.22-- 2 ten cents (10e) Thirtieth to fiftieth birthday. ........2.002200.... ties twenty cents (20c) Viftieth to sixty-fifth birthday......... et eee thirty cents (30c) (Ages shall be defined as having passed a certain birthday instead of nearest birthday.) Assessment shall always be made on the entire membership in good standing, and the frequency of the assessments will be governed by the death rate within the association. Article 7 No benefit will be paid for natural death occurring within thirty days from the date of the certificate of membership. which certificate shall express the TRUE date such person becomes a member of this association, and the certificate issued shall be in acknowledgment of membership in this association. Benefits will be paid for death caused by accidental means occurring any time after date of membership certificate. No benefits will be paid in case of suicidal death of any member within one year from the date of the membership certificate. No agent or other person shall have authority to issue membership certificates in the field, but such membership certificates shall be issued at the home office of the association by duly authorized officersthe president, vice-president or secretary, and a record thereof duly made. Article 8 Any member failing to pay any assessment within thirty days after notice shall be in bad standing and, unless and until restored. shall not be entitled to benefits. Notice shall be presumed duly given when mailed, postage paid, to the last known address of such members: Provided, moreover, that notice to the head of a family shall be construed as notice to the entire membership of such family in said association. Any member or head of a family changing his or her address shall give notice to the secretary-treasurer in writing of such change, giving the old address as well as the new, and the head of a family notifying the secretary-treasurer of change in address shall list with the secretary in such notice all the members of his or her family having membership in said association. Any member in bad standing may, within ninety days after the date of an assessment notice, be reinstated to good standing by the payment of all delinquent dues and assessments and provided such person shall at the same time submit to the secretary-treasurer satisfactory evidence of good health, in writing, and no benefit will be paid for natural death occurring within thirty davs after reinstatement. In case of death caused by accidental means, benefit will be in force immediately after reinstatement. Any person desiring to discontinue his membership for any reason shall communicate such desire to the secretary-treasurer immediately and surrender his or her certificate of membership. Any adult member who is the head of a family, and who, with his family, have become in bad standing, shall furnish to the secretary-treasurer satisfactory evidence of the good health of each member desired to be reinstated in writing. Article 9 The benefits herein provided are for the purpose of furnishing a funeral and burial service for a deceased member. The service shall be in keeping with the services and casket, sold at the same price, similar to that provided and charged by reputable funeral directors of this or other like communities. Article 10 It is understood and stipulated that the funeral and burial service provided in article nine hereof shall be rendered by (give name of funeral director and town), which funeral director is designated in these rules and by-laws as the official funeral director of this association, and such funeral director shall be, by the secretary-treasurer of this association, immediately notified upon the death of any member, and upon the death of any member it shall be the duty of his or her nearest relative to notify the secretary-treasurer of the association of the death of such member. In the event a member in good standing shall die at a place beyond the territory served by the above named funeral director, the secretary of this association, being notified of such death, shall cause the deceased to receive a funeral and burial service equal to that provided for in these by-laws. The benefits provided for are to be payable to the funeral director rendering such funeral and burial service, which payment the secretary-treasurer is authorized to make. If the secretarytreasurer of the association shall fail, on demand, to provide the benefits as listed in article nine of these rules and by-laws by arrangement with the official funeral director serving the community in which the services are required, then the benefits shall be paid in cash to the representative of the deceased qualified under law to receive such payments. Article 11 If the proceeds of one assessment on the entire membership produces more than enough for burial or burials, on account of which said assessment is made, the balance shall be placed in the treasury of the association to apply on future burials. Assessments shall be made in such multiples of the assessment rate as is necessary to provide a fund to take care of anticipated deaths until the next assessment period. Whenever possible, assessments will be made at definitely stated intervals so as to reduce the cost of collection and to prevent lapse. Article 12 In the event the proceeds of one assessment on the entire membership does not prove sufficient at any time to yield the benefit provided for in these by-laws, then the secretarytreasurer shall notify the Insurance Commissioner who shall be authorized, unless the membership is increased to that point where such assessment is sufficient, to cause liquidation of said association, and may transfer all members in good standing to a like organization or association. Article 18 <All legitimate operating expenses of the association shall be paid out of the assessments, but in no case shall the entire expenses exceed twenty-five per cent of the assessments collected: Provided, the entire amount of the membership fee may be used for expenses, if necessary. Article 14 Special meetings of the association membership may be called by the secretary-treasurer when by him deemed necessary or advisable, and he shall call a meeting when petitioned to do so by sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the membership of said association. Article 15 The secretary-treasurer shall, upon satisfactory evidence that membership was granted to any person not qualified at the time of entry as provided under article three of these by-laws, refund any amounts paid as assessment, and shall remove the name from the membership roll. Article 16 Any member may pay any number of assessments in advance, in which case such member will not be further assessed until a like number of assessments shall have been levied against the remaining membership. Article 17 No person may maintain active membership in two separate burial associations, and upon evidence that membership is maintained contrary to this article, the secretary-treasurer may call upon such member to forfeit all benefits and fees paid in either one or the other of the associations: Provided, that in the event a person dies, and if being a member of more than one association, the association not called on to render the funeral and burial service shall be relieved of any claim or demand on account of membership in such association. Article 18 Each year before the annual meeting of the membership of this association the association shall cause to be mailed to each member a statement showing the total income collected, expenses paid and burial benefits provided for the year next past (giving the names of each person buried) : Provided, a statement mailed to the head of a family shall be regarded as notice to each member of such family holding membership in the association. Article 19 These rules and by-laws shall not be modified or abridged except by act of the General Assembly of North Carolina.

Sec. 2 For each precinct the chairman shall have copied in a new registration book, to be known and labeled as The General Election Registration Book, the names only of all registered electors who are shown by the poll book to have voted in such precinct in either the one thousand nine hundred and thirty-six or the one thousand nine hundred and thirtyeight general election or the primary election, except electors who are known by the chairman to have died or moved their voting residence, and to record in said book opposite each name, information available with reference to the race, age, residence, place of birth and the township, county and state from whence he has removed, in the event of a removal. The party affiliation of the voters shall not be entered in this general election registration book. When this is completed, there shall be prepared for each precinct in duplicate a list of all the registered voters whose names were not transferred to the new general election registration book for the reason that such electors did not appear, according to the poll books, to have voted in either the general election or the primary election of one thousand nine hundred and thirty-six or one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight. The said Chairman of the County Board of Elections shall thereafter publish said lists once a week for at least two consecutive weeks in a county journal or in his discretion have said lists posted at the courthouse door of said county at least two weeks prior to the opening of the regular primary registration period notifying all persons on said lists that their names would be erased from the registration books unless such persons personally appeared before their respective registrars during the regular registration period and showed their right to remain on the registration book and vote as qualified electors in said precinct. In the event that either the one thousand nine hundred and thirty-six or one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight poll books for a precinct are lost and cannot be found then the chairman shall order a new registration of voters in such precinct before the primary election. In all counties having had a new countywide registration of voters, either in the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty-six or one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight, the said chairman in said county is authorized to transfer to the new registration books the names of all persons registered therein regardless of whether any of the persons so registered voted in either of said elections or primary elections of one thousand nine hundred and thirty-six or one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight, except that the chairman shall remove from the books the names of all persons known by the chairman to have died or moved their voting residence elsewhere since said registration was held: Provided, however, that if the registration books in those counties having had a new registration within the time above mentioned do not show the party affiliation of the voter together with the other required information then the chairman shall order a new registration therein. In instances where the party affiliation is shown part of the time and is not shown in some cases, then the procedure set forth in the third section of this Act shall be followed: Provided, further, that in those counties having had a new county-wide registration of voters either in the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty-six or one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight, which registration, revision and relisting of voters was performed in substantial compliance with the terms of this Act, in the opinion of the Chairman of the State Board of Elections the said chairman will not be required to comply with the terms and provisions of this Act.

Sec. 3 Where the registration books do not show in part the voters party affiliation, or age, race, residence, place of birth, etc., and the poll book for the precinct shows that such persons voted in either the one thousand nine hundred and thirty-six or the one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight general election, or primary election, then the said chairman shall prepare a list of all such registered personsincluding all of those absent from the county and employed outside of the countyand shall immediately mail a blank form to each of such persons whose address is given or known, instructing them to fill in the requested information on the blank return form enclosed and to return the same to the said chairman or registrar of the precinct by the close of the registration period or their names will be removed from the registration book. It shall then be the duty of the registrar to remove from the registration book the names of all such persons who fail to return the blank return form with the requested information by the close of the registration period. All blank return forms of this kind so received by the registrars shall be kept until after the primary election and thereafter filed with the said chairman along with the precinct returns as part of the public records in the chairmans office: Provided, however, that the provisions of this section shall not be mandatory as to any voter when the Chairman of the County Board of Elections with the assistance of the registrars, or from any available source of information can obtain the facts, set out in said section, required to be obtained by the Election Laws of the State; but in all cases the party affiliation shall be shown on the primary registration books in order for the voter to participate in the primary election. However, in the event that any person, whose name has been removed from the registration book by said County Board of Elections as having been disqualified to vote in the precinct, should appear at the polling place on election or primary day and give satisfactory evidence to the registrar and judges that he had never received any notice by mail or otherwise of his name being placed among the list of disqualified voters in that precinct, and can satisfy said officials that he is qualified to vote in that precinct, then such persons name shall be placed back on the general election registration book and on the primary registration book if he declares his party affiliation as provided in Section six, and he shall be allowed to vote in said precinct as before.

The names of all electors registered on the old books without any party affiliation being given, or who are registered as Independents, or who fail to show their age, race, place of birth, residence, etc., shall not be transcribed to either party primary registration book until the said chairman or registrar shall have received back the blank return form from such electors as above provided for giving the requested information, or shall have obtained said information otherwise as hereinbefore provided in Section three of this Act. Only the party primary registration book of the party participating in a primary election shall be used at the polls at a primary election and if only one party so participates then the other party primary registration book shall not be used or kept at the polls on primary day but shall, after the close of the registration period, be transmitted to the Chairman of the County Board of Elections along with the general election registration book. At a general election, only the general election registration book shall be used at the polls on election day, and after the close of the registration period the two party primary registration books shall be transmitted to the said chairman. In all registrations hereafter held before a primary or an election, the registrars shall register all qualified applieants for registration in both the general election registration book and also in the party primary book of the party with which the elector professes affiliation, but the party affiliations shall not be recorded in the general election registration book. Any applicant for registration who refuses to state his or her party affiliation shall not be registered in a party primary registration book and shall not be permitted to vote in a primary until the affiliation is stated and so recorded in the primary book of such party.

CHAPTER 3 AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR EDUCATION EXPENSE GRANTS FOR CHILDREN ATTENDING NON-PUBLIC SCHOOLS. The General Assembly of North Carolina do enact:

Sec. 1 Chapter 115 of the General Statutes relating to public education is hereby amended by adding a new article, to be designated Article 35, as follows: ARTICLE 35 Education Expense Grants Section 1 Statement of legislative policy and purposes. The General Assembly of North Carolina recognizes and hereby affirms that knowledge, morality, and adherence to fundamental principles of individual freedom and responsibility are necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind; and further affirms that schools and the means of education ought forever to be encouraged. The value and importance of our public schools are known and acknowledged by our people. It is further recognized that our public schools are so intimately related to the customs and feelings of the people of each community that their effective operation is impossible except in conformity with community attitudes. Our people need to be assured that no child will be forced to attend a school with children of another race in order to get an education. It is the purpose of the State of North Carolina to make available, under the conditions and qualifications set out in this Act, education expense grants for the private education of any child of any race residing in this State. In so doing, it is the hope of the General Assembly of North Carolina that all peoples within our State shall respect deeply-felt convictions, and that our public school system shall be continually strengthened and improved, and sustained by the support of all our citizens. Sec. 2 Every child residing in this State for whom no public school is available, or who is assigned to a public school attended by a child of another race against the wishes of his parent or guardian or the person standing in loco parentis to such child, is entitled to apply for an education expense grant from State funds appropriated for that purpose. Such grants shall be available only for education in a private nonsectarian school, and in the case of a child assigned to a public school attended by a child of another race, shall, in addition, be available only when it is not reasonable and practicable to reassign such child to a public school not attended by a child of another race. For purposes of this Article, a nonsectarian school is defined as a school whose operation is not controlled directly or indirectly by any church or sectarian body or by any individual or individuals acting on behalf of a church or sectarian body. Sec. 3 It shall be the policy of the State to make an education expense grant available to each eligible child, as provided under this Article, which is equal to the per-day, per-student amount of State funds expended 4 on public schools throughout the State during the preceding school year, but in no event, shall a grant for any child exceed the amount actually expended for the private education of such child. The State Board of Education shall determine the maximum amount of the grant to be made available to each child, and in so doing, shall take into account the total expenditures for all current expenses and for debt service on State school bonds made from State funds for the preceding school year. Sec. 4 Application for an education expense grant shall be made to the board of education of the administrative unit within which the child resides. Such application shall be on standard forms prescribed by the State Board of Education for that purpose and shall be signed under oath or affirmation by the parent or guardian of or the person standing in loco parentis to the child for whom application is made. Sec. 5 Application for an education expense grant shall be approved if the board of education to whom application is made finds that: (a) the child for whom application is made resides within the administrative unit; and (b) there is no public school available for such child, or such child is now assigned against the wishes of his parent or guardian or of the person standing in loco parentis to such child to a public school attended by a child of another race and it is not reasonable and practicable to reassign such child to a public school not attended by a child of another race; and (c) such child is enrolled in or has been accepted for enrollment in a private nonsectarian school, recognized and approved under Article 32 of this Chapter. Sec. 6 Each application for an education expense grant shall specify the number of school days for which the grant is requested, but in no event shall any one application be for more than one school year or the equivalent of one hundred and eighty -180 school days. If the conditions of Section 5 of this Article continue to be met, application may be filed on behalf of a child, who has received benefits under a previous application, for another school year or part thereof. Sec. 7 Upon approving the application for an education expense grant from State funds, the board of education shall give notice in writing to the parent or guardian or person standing in loco parentis to the child concerned of an education grant commitment for a specified number of school days and for a specified amount for each school day, but no one commitment shall exceed one hundred and eighty -180 school days. So long as the requirements set out in paragraphs (a) and (c) of Section 5 of this Article are met during the period of the education grant commitment, the board, unless requested otherwise by the parent or guardian or person standing in loco parentis, shall continue payments under such commitment notwithstanding the fact that a change of conditions since approval of the application may make it reasonable and practicable to assign such child to a public school not atteaded by a child of another race. Sec. 8 Upon disapproval of an application for an education expense grant, whether payable from State or local funds, the board of education 5 shall give notice to the applicant by registered mail, and any applicant may within ten -10 days after receipt of such notice apply to such board for a hearing, and shall be given a prompt and fair hearing on the question of entitlement to an education expense grant. The board shall render prompt decision upon such hearing, and if the board shall affirm its previous action of disapproval of the application, notice shall be given to the applicant by registered mail, and any applicant aggrieved by the action of the board may within ten -10 days after receipt of such notice file a petition in the superior court of the county in which the board sits for a hearing in the matter on all questions of fact and of law. Notice of the petition shall be properly served upon the board of education. The board shall have fifteen -15 days after receipt of notice of the petition within which to prepare and furnish to the petitioner or his attorney a certified transcript of the record in the case for filing in the superior court, which record shall include a copy of the application and any official orders and rulings of the board in the case. Additional time for preparation of the record may be granted to the board, for good cause, upon motion before the clerk of the superior court. The petition in the superior court may be heard by the resident judge of the district or by the judge presiding at a term of court in that district, and such judge shall have authority to take testimony and examine into the facts of the case, and to determine all questions of fact and of law, and enter judgment thereon. From the judgment of the superior court an appeal may be taken by the petitioner or the board to the Supreme Court in the same manner as other appeals are taken from judgments of such court in civil actions. Sec. 9 Payments of education expense grants shall be made by check upon receipt of satisfactory evidence that the child for whom payment is made actually attended a private nonsectarian school, recognized and approved under Article 32 of this Chapter. The school attended shall furnish, upon forms prescribed by the State Board of Education, a sworn certificate signed by the director or other appropriate official of the school, showing the number of school days actually attended by the child for whom payment is made. A child is deemed to be in attendance, within the meaning of this Section, although temporarily absent due to illness or other good cause, so long as such child is enrolled in the school as a bona fide student. Checks in payment of education expense grants shall be made payable jointly to the parent or guardian of or the person standing in loco parentis to the child and the school which the child attended, and shall be mailed to the parent or guardian or person standing in loco parentis for endorsement; provided, that if the school attended shall indicate in its certificate that the tuition and expenses for such child have already been paid the check shall be made payable to the parent or guardian or person standing in loco parentis alone. Sec. 10 Payments of education expense grants shall be made by each board of education monthly, bimonthly or quarterly in accordance with uniform regulations adopted and promulgated by the State Board of Education. The State Board of Education is authorized and directed to prescribe standard forms for application for grants, for notice of education 6 grant commitment, for certificates of attendance, and such other forms as may be necessary or desirable in the administration of the provisions of this Article. The State Board of Education shall have general supervision and administration of the funds provided by the General Assembly for education expense grants, and it is intended that such funds shall be managed and allotted by the Controller of the State Board of Education, under direction of the Board, pursuant to the relevant provisions of Chapter 115 of the General Statutes governing administration of fiscal affairs of the Board. See, 11 Payments of individual education expense grants from State funds shall be made only by warrants drawn on the State Treasurer, signed by the chairman and the secretary of the county or city board of education. The fiscal procedures prescribed in other Articles of this Chapter, unless in conflict with some specific provision in this Article, shall apply to the handling and management of State funds appropriated for education expense grants. Sec. 12 No education expense grant shall be paid for any child except for attendance at a private nonsectarian school found to be in compliance with the provisions of Article 32 of this Chapter. It shall be the duty of the State Board of Education to maintain a current list of all such approved schools and to furnish such information from time to time to county and city boards of education. Payment of education expense grants for or on behalf of any child attending such a school shall not vest in the State of North Carolina, the State Board of Education or any agency or political subdivision of the State any supervision or control whatever over such nonpublic schools or any responsibility whatever for their conduct and operation. Sec. 18 The appropriate tax levying authorities for any administrative unit may, upon recommendation of the board of education of such unit, appropriate amounts from any local tax or non-tax funds for a local education expense grant. In no event, shall the combined total of grants for any one child, from both State and local funds, exceed the amount of actual expenses incurred in the private education of such child. Sec. 14 Application for a local education expense grant shall be filed with the board of education of the administrative unit when local funds have been appropriated or allotted for such purpose. No child shall be entitled to a local education expense grant who is not at the same time eligible, under the provisions of this Article, for a grant from State funds. Sec. 15 Each application for a local education expense grant shall specify the number of school days for which the grant is requested, but in no event shall any one application be granted for more than one school year or the equivalent of one hundred and eighty -180 school days. If the child who has received benefits under a previous application continues to be otherwise eligible, an application for a local education expense grant for another school year or part thereof may be filed in his behalf. Sec. 16 Payments of local education expense grants shall be made by check upon receipt of satisfactory evidence that the child for whom payment is made actually attended a private nonsectarian school recognized and 7 approved under Article 32 of this Chapter. The school attended shall furnish, in such form as may be prescribed by the local board of education, a sworn certificate signed by the director or other appropriate official of the school, showing the number of school days actually attended by the child for whom payment is made. A child is deemed to be in attendance, within the meaning of this Section, although temporarily absent due to illness or other good cause, so long as such child is enrolled in such school as a bona fide student. Checks in payment of local education expense grants shall be made payable jointly to the parent or guardian of or the person standing in loco parentis to the child and the school which the child attended, and shall be mailed to the parent or guardian or person standing in loco parentis for endorsement; provided, that if the school attended shall indicate in its certificate that the tuition and expenses for such child have already been paid the check shall be made payable to the parent or guardian or person standing in loco parentis alone. Sec. 17 Payments of local education expense grants shall be made by each board of education monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by each local board. In administering local grant payments, each board shall, so far as practicable, follow the procedures prescribed by the State Board of Education for the payment of education expense grants from State funds. Sec. 18 All local funds for education expense grants, from whatever source provided, shall be managed, supervised and disbursed in accordance with the procedures set out in other Articles of this Chapter, pertaining to administration of local school funds, except where such procedures are in conflict with some provision of this Article. Sec. 19 No local education expense grant shall be paid for or on behalf of any child except for attendance at a private nonsectarian school found to be in compliance with the provisions of Article 32 of this Chapter. Sec. 20 Any person who shall knowingly make any FALSE affidavit or shall knowingly swear or affirm falsely to any matter or thing required by the terms of this Article to be sworn or affirmed to shall be guilty of perjury, and upon conviction shall be punishable by a fine and imprisonment as other persons committing perjury are punishable. Sec. 21 It shall be unlawful for any parent or guardian or the person standing in loco parentis to a child to accept any payment authorized by this Article knowing that the child for whose benefit the payment is received did not actually attend, or was not actually a bona fide student at, a private nonsectarian school during the period for which payment is received. Any person violating this Section shall be guilty of a felony and upon conviction shall be punished by imprisonment in the States prison for not more than five -5 years or by a fine of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or by both such fine and imprisonment. Sec. 22 It shall be unlawful for any official or employee of any school, acting wilfully or corruptly, to receive any payment of a grant authorized by this Article, knowing that said school is not entitled to such payment. Any person violating this Section shall be guilty of a felony and upon con- 8 viction shall be punished by imprisonment in the States prison for not more than five -5 years or by a fine of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or by both such fine and imprisonment.

CHAPTER 254 AN ACT TO AMEND CHAPTER 71 OF THE GENERAL STATUTES RELATIVE TO THE HALIWA INDIANS OF HALIFAX AND WAR- REN COUNTIES. WHEREAS, many of the Indians now living in Halifax, Warren and adjoining counties are descendants of a once large and prosperous tribe which occupied lands along the Roanoke River at the time of the earliest white settlements in the Roanoke River Valley; and WHEREAS, according to historical sources, when early colonists from coastal Virginia and North Carolina extended their colonization into that portion of the Roanoke River Valley country now designated as Halifax and Warren Counties, they found certain forbears of these Indians already well established there, a distinctive people living in settled towns and communities, in permanent family dwellings similar to European type residences, with some owning slaves, tending domesticated livestock, tilling the soil, and practicing many of the arts and crafts of European civiliza- tion; and WHEREAS, by tribal legend supported by distinctive appearance and features, manner of speech, and by the frequent recurrence among the tribal members of family names of English and European origin, similar to family names found in the rosters of earlier English settlements or at- tempted settlements, these Indians may and with considerable reason do trace their origin to certain coastal Indian tribes; and WHEREAS, evidences that these Indians populated this section have been found through exploratory and scientific operations and research in the Roanoke River Valley, and in the discovery of ceremonial Indian burial mounds; and WHEREAS, these people are naturally and understandably proud of their heritage and are desirous of confirming their social and ethnic identity and preserving their racial history: Now, therefore, The General Assembly of North Carolina do enact:

Sec. 1 Chapter 71 of the General Statutes of North Carolina pertaining to Indians shall be and the same is hereby amended by adding a new Section to be designated as G. S. 71-7, which shall read as follows: 71-7. The Indians now residing in Halifax, Warren and adjoining counties of North Carolina, originally found by the first permanent white settlers on the Roanoke River in Halifax and Warren Counties, and claiming descent from certain tribes of Indians originally inhabiting the coastal regions of North Carolina, shall, from and after the effective date of this Section be known and may be designated as the Haliwa Indians of North Carolina, and they shall continue to enjoy all their rights, privileges and immunities as citizens of the State as now or hereafter provided by law, and shall continue to be subject to all the obligations and duties of citizens under the law.

WHEREAS, two residents (husband and wife), of Guilford County, North Carolina, pursuant to_the terms of a written placement agreement entered into with the Childrens Home Society of Nortk Carolina, Inc., received into their home, in 1964, an infant cnild, a ward of the said Childrens Home Society of North Carolina, Inc., with the intention of adopting said child; and WHEREAS, the said child thereafter resided continuously in the home of the said proposed adoptive parents and was treated in all 454 respects as if it were their own child and was given the care and affection of parents; and WHEREAS, prior to the filing of a Petition for Adoption of said child, the proposed adoptive father died unexpectedly as the result of a heart attack in January of 1965; and WHEREAS, the surviving spouse of the proposed adoptive father, by and with the consent of the Childrens Home Society of North Carolina, Ine., on the 2nd day of March, 1965, instituted adoption proceedings in the Superior Court of Guilford County, North Carolina, and in said pro- ceeding requested a change in the name of said child so as to give to said child the surname of the deceased proposed adoptive father; and WHEREAS, a final order for adoption was entered in the said Superior Court on the 25th day of May, 1965, establishing the relation- ship of parent and child between said child and the aforesaid surviving spouse (mother) and further providing that the childs name _ should thereafter be as requested in the Petition for Adoption, and ordering the State Registrar of Vital Statistics to issue a new birth certificate for said child in accordance with the provisions of Section 48-29 of the General Statutes of North Carolina; and WHEREAS, pursuant to the provisions of Section 48-29 of the said General Statutes the State Registrar did issue a new Certificate of Live Birth for said child, which certificate is recorded in Volume 64, Page 030766, Office of Vital Statistics, Raleigh, North Carolina; and WHEREAS, the aforesaid new Certificate of Live Birth for said child does not show thereon the name, age, (at time of childs birth), race or birthplace of the deceased proposed adoptive father of said child, and the Attorney General of the State of North Carolina has rendered an opinion that where a proposed adoptive father dies before an interlocutory decree is entered in an adoption proceeding, the Office of Vital Statistics is without authority to show the name of the said deceased proposed adoptive father on the new birth certificate, notwithstanding that the surviving spouse of the proposed adoptive parents becomes the adoptive parent of the child; and WHEREAS, the adoptive parent (mother) of said child desires to have shown on the new Certificate of Live Birth of said child the name, age, (at time of childs birth), race and birthplace of her deceased husband as the adoptive father of said child in order that full parentage may be shown on the childs birth certificate: Now, therefore, The General Assembly of North Carolina do enact:

Sec. 1 That the State Registrar of the Office of Vital Statistics is hereby empowered and directed to amend the Certificate of Live Birth recorded in Volume 64, Page 030766, Office of Vital Statistics, Raleigh, N. C. which amended birth certificate shall contain, in addition to the information already shown thereon, under the heading father on said certificate, the name, age, (at time of childs birth), race and birthplace of the deceased spouse of the adoptive parent (mother) of said child. This Section shall not be construed to entitle the child named in said birth certificate to inherit real and personal property by, through, and from the individual named as father on said amended birth certificate. 455

CHAPTER 885 AN ACT TO REWRITE CHAPTER 48 OF THE GENERAL STATUTES RELATING TO ADOPTIONS.

Sec. 1 Chapter 48 of the General Statutes of North Carolina is hereby rewritten to read as follows: 48-1. Legislative intent; construction of Chapter. The General Assembly hereby declares as a matter of legislative policy with respect to adoption that -1 The primary purpose of this Chapter is to protect children from unnecessary separation from parents who might give them good homes and loving care, to protect them from adoption by persons unfit to have the responsibility of their care and rearing, and to protect them from interference, long after they have become properly adjusted in their adoptive homes, by natural parents who may have some legal claim because of a defect in the adoption procedure. -2 The secondary purpose of this Chapter is to protect the natural parents from hurried decisions, made under strain and anxiety, to give up a child, and to protect foster parents from assuming responsibility for a child about whose heredity or mental or physical condition they know nothing, and to prevent later disturbance of their relationship to the child by natural parents whose legal rights have not been fully protected. -3 When the interest of a child and those of an adult are in conflict, such conflict should be resolved in favor of the child; and to that end this Chapter should be liberally construed. 48-2. Definitions. In this Chapter, unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires -1 Adult person means any person who has attained the age of twenty-one years. -2 Licensed child-placing agency means any agency operating under a license to place children for adoption issued by the State Board of Public Welfare, or, in the event that such agency is in another state or territory or in the District of Columbia, operating under a license to place children for adoption issued by the State Welfare Agency or other duly authorized agency of such state, territory, or the District of Columbia. 48-3. Who may be adopted. Any minor child may be adopted in accordance with the provisions of this Act. 48-4. Who may adopt children. (a) any person over twentyone years of age may petition in a special proceeding in the Superior Court to adopt a minor child and for a change of the name of such child. If the petitioner has a husband or wife living, competent to join in the petition, such spouse shall join in the petition. (b) Provided, however, that if the spouse of the petitioner in a natural parent of the child to be adopted, such spouse need not join in the petition but need only to give consent as provided in G. S. 48-7, (d). (c) Provided further, that the petitioner or petitioners shall have resided in North Carolina for one year next preceding the filing of the petition. 48-5. Parents, etc., not necessary parties to adoption proceedings upon finding of abandonment. (a) In all cases where a court of competent jurisdiction has declared a child to be an abandoned child, the parent, parents, or guardian of the person shall not be necessary parties to any proceeding under this Chapter, nor shall their consent be required. (b) In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction has not theretofore declared the child to be an abandoned child, then on written notice of not less than five days to the parent, parents, or guardian of the person, the court in the adoption proceeding is hereby authorized to determine that an abandonment has taken place. (c) If the parent, parents, or guardian of the person deny that an abandonment has taken place, this issue of fact shall be determined as provided in G. S. 1-273, and if abandonment be determined, then the consent of the parent, parents, or guardian of the person shall not be required. Upon final determination of this issue of fact the proceeding shall be transferred back to the special proceedings docket for further action by the clerk. (d) A copy of the order of the court declaring a child abandoned must be filed in the proceeding with the petition in which case the consent required under G. S. 48-7 must be given in accordance with G. S. 48-9, Subsection (2). 48-6. When consent of father not necessary. In the case of a child born out of wedlock and when said child has not been legitimated as provided by law, the written consent of the mother alone shall be sufficient under the Chapter and the putative father need not be made a party to the proceeding. 48-7. When consent of parents is necessary. (a) Except as provided in G. S. 48-5, and G. S. 48-6, and if they are living and have not released all rights to the child or consented to an adoption as provided in G. S. 48-9, the parents or surviving parent or guardian of the person of the child must be a party or parties of record to the proceeding and must give written consent to the adoption, which must be filed with the petition. (b) In any case where the parents or surviving parent or guardian of the person of the child whose adoption is sought are necessary parties and their address is known, or can by due and diligent search be ascertained, that fact must be made known to the court by proper allegation in the petition or by affidavit and service of process must be made upon such person as provided by law for service of process on residents of the State or by service of process on non-residents as provided in G. S. 1-104. (c) If the address of such person cannot be ascertained for the purpose of service of process or service of process cannot be made as hereinbefore provided, that fact must be made known to the court by proper allegation in the petition or by affidavit to the effect that after due and diligent search such person cannot be found for the purpose of service of process. Service of process upon such person may then be made by publication of summons as provided by G. S. Jan-98 et seq., and as provided by law. (d) When a step-parent petitions to adopt a step-child, consent to the adoption must be given by the spouse of the petitioner. 48-8. Capacity of parents to consent. A parent who has not reached the age of twenty-one years shall have legal capacity to give consent to an adoption and to release such parents rights in a child, and shall be as fully bound thereby as if said parent had attained twenty-one years of age. 48-9. When consent may be given by persons other than parents. (a) In the following instances written consent sufficient for the purposes of the adoption filed with the petition shall be sufficient to make the person giving consent a party tothe proceeding and no service of any process need be made upon such person. -1 When the parent, parents, or guardian of the person of the child, has in writing surrendered the child to a superintendent of public welfare of a county or to a licensed child-placing agency upon a standard form to be supplied by the State Board of Public Welfare and at the same time in writing has consented to an adoption of the child, the superintendent of public welfare or the executive head of such agency shall give consent to the adoption of the child by the petitioners. A county superintendent of public welfare may accept the surrender of a child who was born in the county or whose parent or parents have established residence in the county. -2 If the court finds as a fact that there is no person qualified to give legal consent as provided in this Section, or that one of them cannot do so because of mental incapacity, the court May appoint some suitable person or the county superintendent of public welfare of the county in which the child resides to act in the proceeding as next friend of the child to give or withhold such consent. (b) The surrender of the child and consent for the child to be adopted given by the parent or guardian of the person to the superintendent of public welfare or to the licensed childplacing agency shall be filed with the petition along with the consent of the superintendent of public welfare or of the executive head of the agency to the adoption prayed for in the petition. 48-10. When childs consent necessary. In any proceeding under this Article, a child who is twelve years of age or over or who becomes twelve years of age before the granting of the final order must also consent to the proposed adoption. 48-11. Consent not revocable. No consent described in G. S. 48-6, 48-7, or 48-9, shall be revocable by the consenting party after the entering of an interlocutory decree or a final order of adoption when the entering of an interlocutory decree has been waived in accordance with the provisions of G. S. 48-21. Any person who has consented to an adoption as herein provided shall be deemed to be a party to the adoption proceeding * and shall be bound thereby. 48-12. Nature of proceeding; venue. Adoption shall be by a special proceeding before the Clerk of the Superior Court. The petition may be filed in the county: -1 where the petitioners reside; or -2 where the child resides; or -3 where the child resided when it became a public charge; or -4 in which is located any child-placing agency or institution operating under the laws of this State and having custody of the child or to which the child shall have been surrendered as provided in G. S. 48-9. 48-13. Reference to parental status. No reference shall be made in any petition, interlocutory decree, or final order of adoption to the marital status of the natural parents of the child sought to be adopted, to their fitness for the care and custody of such child, or to their abandonment thereof, nor shall any reference be made to any child being born out of wedlock. A clerk of court must not receive and file any papers which violate the provisions of this Section. 48-14. Use of original name of child unnecessary; name used in proceedings for adoption. (a) Only in the report required by G. S. 48-16 on the investigation of the condition and antecedents of the child sought to be adopted shall the original name of the child given by the natural parent or parents be necessary. (b) In the petition, interlocutory decree, and final order of adoption and in all other papers related to the case the name selected by the petitioner or petitioners as the name for the child may be used as the TRUE and legal name and the original name shall not be necessary. 48-15. The petition for adoption. (a) The caption of the petition shall be substantially as follows: STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE SUPERIOR COURT pated a ody toh so eee Mee ae COUNTY BEFORE THE CLERK and PETITION (Full name of adopting mother) FOR ADOPTION FOR THE ADOPTION OF (Full name of child as used in proceeding) Nee Nee eee Nee Ne i Oe le a (b) The petition may be prepared on a standard form to be | supplied by the State Board of Public Welfare, or may be typewritten, giving all the information hereinafter required.

(b) The court may order the superintendent of public welfare of one county to make an investigation of the condition and antecedents of the child and the superintendent of public welfare of another county or counties to make any other part of the necessary investigation. (c) The county superintendent or superintendents of public welfare or the authorized representative of such agency described hereinbefore must make a written report within 60 days of his or their findings, on a standard form or following an outline supplied by the State Board of Public Welfare, for the examination by the court of adoption. 48-17. Interlocutory decree of adoption. (a) Upon examination of the written report required in Section 48-16, the court may issue in triplicate an interlocutory decree of adoption giving the care and custody of the child to the petitioners. Such interlocutory decree must be issued within six months of the filing of the petition unless a final order is entered as provided in G. S. 48-21 (c). It may be issued on a standard form supplied by the State Board of Public Welfare or may be typewritten, giving all the information hereinafter required. (b) The interlocutory decree must state: -1 that all necessary parties are properly before the court and that the time for answering has expired; -2 the name of the child used in the petition; -3 the full names of the petitioners and their county of residence; -4 the fact and date of filing of the petition; and -5 when the petitioners acquired custody of the child and from what person or agency.

Such decree shall be provisional only and may be rescinded or modified at any time prior to the final order of adoption. Until the final order of adoption is made, the child shall be a ward of the court having jurisdiction. (b) When a husband and wife have petitioned jointly to adopt and an interlocutory decree has been entered, and the death of one spouse occurs before the time for the entering of the final order, the petition of the living petitioner shall not be invalidated by the fact of the death of the other petitioner, and the court may proceed to grant the adoption to the surviving petitioner. 48-19. Report on placement after interlocutory decree. When the court enters an interlocutory decree of adoption, it must order the county superintendent of public welfare or a licensed child-placing agency through its duly authorized representative to supervise the child in its adoptive home and report to the court on the placement in writing in accordance with an outline or form supplied by the State Board of Public Welfare, such report being for examination by the court before entering any final order. 48-20. Dismissal of proceeding.

(d) Upon examination of the written report required under G. S. 48-16 the court may, in its discretion, shorten the probationary period between the granting of the interlocutory decree and the final order of adoption by the length of the time the child has resided in the home of the petitioners prior to the granting of the interlocutory decree; provided that the child was placed in the home of the petitioners by a superintendent of public welfare or by a licensed child-placing agency and such fact has been certified to the court by the superintendent of public welfare or the executive head of the child-placing agency, but no final order shall be entered until the child shall have resided in the home of the petitioners for a period of one year. 48-22. Contents of final order.

Procedure when appeal is taken. (a) In the event of an appeal from ruling of the clerk in an adoption proceeding, the clerk must impound all papers and reports not open to the public pending final determination of the appeal. Within ten days after final determination of the appeal, the clerk must forward all papers and reports as specified in G. S. 48-24. (b) The clerk must not at any time furnish to anyone copies or certified copies of any documents in the proceeding other than the petition, the interlocutory decree, and the final order. 48-28. Questioning validity of adoption proceeding. (a) After the final order of adoption is signed, no party to an adoption proceeding nor anyone claiming under such a party may later question the validity of the adoption proceeding by reason of any defect or irregularity therein, jurisdictional or otherwise, but shall be fully bound thereby, save for such appeal as may be allowed by law. No adoption may be questioned by reason of any procedural or other defect by any one not injured by such defect, nor may any adoption proceeding be attacked either directly or collaterally by any person other than a natural parent or guardian of the person of the child. The failure on the part of the Clerk of the Superior Court, the county superintendent of public welfare, or the executive head of a licensed child-placing agency to perform any of the duties or acts within the time required by the provisions of this Act shall not affect the validity of any adoption proceeding. (b) The final order of adoption shall have the force and effect of, and shall be entitled to, all the presumptions attached to a judgment rendered by a court of general jurisdiction. 48-29. Report of change of name to registrar of vital statistics; entry on birth certificate. (a) Whenever in the final order of adoption the name of a child is changed, the court must immediately enter an order directing the State Registrar of Vital Statistics to make a new birth certificate for the child bearing the new name as shown in the order of adoption, name of the adoptive father, maiden name of the adoptive mother, sex, race, and date of birth of the child. No reference in the new birth certificate shall be made to the adoption nor shall the adopting parents be referred to as foster parents. (b) The State Registrar shall place the original certificate of birth and all papers in his possession relating to the adoption under seal which shall not be broken except upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Thereafter, when a certified copy of the certificate of birth of such person is issued, it shall be a copy of the new birth certificate, except when an order of a court of competent jurisdiction shall require the issuance of a copy of the original certificate of birth. (c) The State Registrar shall send a copy of the new birth certificate to the register of deeds of the county where the adoption proceedings were instituted. 48-30. Guardian appointed when custody granted of child with estate. When the court grants the petitioners custody of a child, if the child is an orphan and without guardian and possesses any estate to be administered, the court must appoint a guardian as provided by law. 48-31. Rights of adoptive parents. When a child is adopted pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter, the adoptive parents shall not thereafter be deprived of any rights in the child, at the instance of the natural parents or otherwise, except in the same manner and for the same causes as are applicable in proceedings to deprive natural parents of their children. 48-32. Procuring custody of child by forfeiting parents declared crime. Any parent whose rights and privileges have been forefeited as provided by G. S. 48-5 and who shall, otherwise than by legal process, procure the possession and custody of such child with respect to whom his rights and privileges have been forfeited shall be guilty of a crime, and shall be punished as for abduction. 48-33. Past adoption proceedings validated. All proceedings for the adoption of minors in courts of this State are hereby validated and confirmed, and the orders and judgments heretofore entered therein are declared to be binding upon all parties to said proceedings and their privies and all other persons, until such orders or judgments shall be vacated as provided by law; provided that this Section shall not apply to litigation pending on the effective date of this Act in which the validity of a prior adoption proceeding is involved. 48-34. Prior proceedings not affected. Adoption proceedings pending on June 30th, 1947 shall not be affected, except that the provisions of G. S. 48-33 shall apply thereto and such proceedings shall be completed in accordance with provisions of the Statutes in effect at the time such proceedings were instituted; provided that the petitioners in proceedings pending on June 30th, 1947 may discontinue. such proceedings by taking voluntary nonsuits and, upon paying the costs accrued in such discontinued proceedings, may institute new proceedings under the provisions of this Act, in which cases all of the provisions of this Act shall apply.

CHAPTER 300 AN ACT TO REWRITE CHAPTER 48 OF THE GENERAL STATUTES RELATING TO ADOPTIONS OF MINOR CHILDREN AND TO INCORPORATE THEREIN THE PROVISIONS OF H. B. 65 OF THE GENERAL ASSEM- BLY OF 1947 AS THE SAME APPEARS AS CHAPTER 885 OF THE NORTH CAROLINA SESSION LAWS OF 1947 WITH CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS THERETO. WHEREAS, the General Assembly of North Carolina at its 1947 Session considered, approved, ratified and intended to enact into law House Bill No. 65 entitled An Act to Rewrite Chapter 48 of the General Statutes Relating to Adoptions; and WHEREAS, the legislative procedure in respect to said Act was proper and complete except for the accidental omission of an enacting clause, as will appear by reference to the journals, minutes and other records of the General Assembly of 1947 and to the records of the Secretary of State; and WHEREAS, the clear and unmistakable intent and purpose of the Legislature that said Act should become law is evidenced by such records, and more specifically by reference to pages 1212 through 1224 of the North Carolina Session Laws of 1947, where said Act now appears as Chapter 885 of the Session Laws of 1947 in the identical form in which it was considered, ap-) proved, passed and ratified on April 4, 1947 by the General As- sembly of North Carolina; and WHEREAS, after the passage and ratification of said Act the omission of an enacting clause became apparent, and it was deemed advisable to submit the question of the effect of such omission to the Supreme Court of North Carolina, and WHEREAS, the Supreme Court in an advisory opinion handed down on the 9th day of June, 1947, in re: House Bill No. 65 designated as Chapter 885 of the Session Laws of 1947, held that such omission of an enacting clause was fatal to the validity of the Act; and WHEREAS, with the exception of this technical defect, the 1947 Act in all other respects was passed and ratified in due form, and represents the legislative intent and purpose of the General Assembly of 1947 as expressed in House Bill No. 65, which now appears as Chapter 885 of the North Carolina Ses- sion Laws of 1947:00:00 Now, therefore, in order to give full effect to such legislative intent and purpose by incorporating the provisions of House Bill No. 65 and Chapter 885 of the Session Laws of 1947, with clarifying amendments, into the General Statutes of North Carolina, aie zs The General Assembly of North Carolina do enact:

Sec. 1 Chapter 48 of the General Statutes of North Carolina is hereby rewritten, so as to conform, as herein set out, to the provisions of H. B. 65 as approved, passed, and ratified on April 4, 1947 by the General Assembly of North Carolina, session of 1947, so that said Chapter 48 of the General Statutes of North Carolina as hereby rewritten shall read as follows: 48-1. Legislative intent: construction of chapter. The General Assembly hereby declares as a matter of legislative policy with respect to adoption that -1 The primary purpose of this Chapter is to protect children from unnecessary separation from parents who might give them good homes and loving care, to protect them from adoption by persons unfit to have the responsibility of their care and rearing, and to protect them from interference, long after they have become properly adjusted in their adoptive homes, by natural parents who may have some legal claim because of a defect in the adoption procedure. -2 The secondary purposes of this Chapter is to protect the natural parents from hurried decisions, made under strain and anxiety, to give up a child, and to protect foster parents from assuming responsibility for a child about whose heredity or mental or physical condition they know nothing, and to prevent later disturbance of their relationship to the child by natural parents whose legal rights have not been fully protected. -3 When the interests of a child and those of an adult are in conflict, such conflict should be resolved in favor of the child; and to that end this Chapter should be liberally construed. 48-2. Definitions. In this Chapter, unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires -1 Adult person means any person who has attained the age of twenty-one years. -2 Licensed child-placing agency means any agency operating under a license to place children for adoption issued by the State Board of Public Welfare, or in the event that such agency is in another state or territory or in the District of Columbia, operating under a license to place children for adoption issued by a governmental authority of such state, territory, or the District of Columbia, empowered by law to issue such licenses. -3 For the purpose of this Chapter, an abandoned child shall be any child under the age of eighteen years who has been willfully abandoned at least six consecutive months immediately preceding institution of an action or proceeding to declare the child to be an abandoned child. -4 Readoption means an adoption by any person of a child who has been previously legally adopted. 48-3. Who may be adopted. Any minor child, irrespective of place of birth or place of residence, may be adopted in accordance with the provisions of this Act. 48-4. Who may adopt children. (a) Any person over twentyone years of age may petition in a special proceeding in the Superior Court to adopt a minor child and may also petition for a change of the name of such child. If the petitioner has a husband or wife living, competent to join in the petition, such spouse shall join in the petition. (b) Provided, however, that if the spouse of the petitioner is a natural parent of the child to be adopted, such spouse need not join in the petition but need only to give consent as provided in G. S. 48-7. (d). (c) Provided further, that the petitioner or petitioners shall have resided in North Carolina, or on Federal territory within the boundaries of North Carolina, for one year next preceding the filing of the petition. 48-5, Parents, etc., not necessary parties to adoption proceedings upon finding of abandonment. (a) In all cases where a court of competent jurisdiction has declared a child to be an abandoned child, the parent, parents, or guardian of the person, declared guilty of such abandonment shall not be necessary parties to any proceeding under this Chapter nor shall their consent be required. (b) In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction has not heretofore declared the child to be an abandoned child, then on written notice of not less than ten days to the parent, parents, or guardian of the person, the court in the adoption proceeding is hereby authorized to determine whether an abandonment has taken place. (c) If the parent, parents, or guardian of the person deny that an abandonment has taken place, this issue of fact shall be determined as provided in G. S. 1-273, and if abandonment is determined, then the consent of the parent, parents, or guardian of the person shall not be required. Upon final determination of this issue of fact the proceeding shall be transferred back to the special proceedings docket for further action by the clerk. (d) A copy of the order of the court declaring a child abandoned must be filed in the proceeding with the petition in which case consent must be given or withheld in accordance with G. S. 48-9, Subsection (2). 48-6. When consent of father not necessary. In the case of a child born out of wedlock and when said child has not been legitimated prior to the time of the signing of the consent, the written consent of the mother alone shall be sufficient under this Chapter and the father need not be made a party to the proceeding. 48-7, When consent of parents is necessary. (a) Except as provided in G. S. 48-5, and G. S. 48-6, and if they are living and have not released all rights to the child and consented generally to adoption as provided in G. S. 48-9, the parents or surviving parent or guardian of the person of the child must be a party or parties of record to the proceeding and must give written consent to adoption, which must be filed with the petition. (b) In any case where the parents or surviving parent or guardian of the person of the child whose adoption is sought are necessary parties and their address is known, or can by due and diligent search be ascertained, that fact must be made known to the court by proper allegation in the petition or by affidavit and service of process must be made upon such person as provided by law for service of process on residents of the State or by service of process on non-residents as provided in G. S. 1-104. (c) If the address of such person cannot be ascertained for the purpose of service of process or service of process cannot be made as hereinbefore provided, that fact must be made known to the court by proper allegation in the petition or by affidavit to the effect that after due and diligent search such person cannot be found for the purpose of service of process.

CHAPTER 874 AN ACT RELATING TO THE LUMBEE INDIANS OF NORTH CARO- LINA. WHEREAS, many Indians now living in Robeson and adjoining coun- ties are descendants of that once large and prosperous tribe which occupied the lands along the Lumbee River at the time of the earliest white settle- ments in that section; and WHEREAS, at the time of their first contacts with the colonists, these Indians were a well established and distinctive people living in European- type houses in settled towns and communities, owning slaves and livestock, tilling the soil, and practicing many of the arts and crafts of European civilization; and WHEREAS, by reason of tribal legend, coupled with a distinctive ap- pearance and manner of speech and the frequent recurrence among them of family names such as Oxendine, Locklear, Chavis, Drinkwater, Bullard, Lowery, Sampson and others, also found on the roster of the earliest English settlement, these Indians may, with considerable show of reason, trace their origin to an admixture of colonial blood with certain coastal tribes of Indians; WHEREAS, these people are naturally and understandably proud of their heritage, and desirous of establishing their social status and pre- serving their racial history: Now, therefore, The General Assembly of North Carolina do enact:

Sec. 1 The Indians now residing in Robeson and adjoining counties of North Carolina, originally found by the first white settlers on the Lumbee River in Robeson County, and claiming joint descent from remnants of early American Colonists and certain tribes of Indians originally inhabiting the coastal regions of North Carolina, shall, from and after the ratification of this Act, be known and designated as Lumbee Indians of North Carolina and shall continue to enjoy all rights, privileges and immunities enjoyed by them as citizens of the State as now provided by law, and shall continue to be subject to all the obligations and duties of citizens under the law.

CHAPTER 968 AN ACT TO INCORPORATE AND ESTABLISH THE EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. WHEREAS, it has been established and recognized by educators special- izing in the education of the deaf throughout the United States that an enrollment of five hundred -500 students in a school is the maximum for effective work as well as skillful and competent education in this field; and WHEREAS, California, Pennsylvania and other states have recognized this standard or maximum enrollment by establishing new schools for the deaf when the level of enrollment of five hundred -500 persons or students was reached in existing schools; and WHEREAS, the current proposed appropriations will provide for an increase to five hundred -500 students at the North Carolina School for the Deaf at Morganton during the 1961-1963 biennium and the Director of that school and the Board of Trustees at that school agree on the necessity for a new school for the deaf in North Carolina, preferably in Eastern North Carolina, and the necessity for its activation sometime in the bien- nium 1963-1965; and WHEREAS, O. H. Pons, President of the Board of Directors of the North Carolina School for the Deaf at Morganton, has been authorized by his Board of Directors to make a statement relating to this proposed school for the deaf which statement is as follows: It is the opinion of the Board of Directors and of the Administration that the School for the Deaf in Morganton has reached a maximum recom- mended size for ideal educational facilities for the deaf. The Board and the Administration favors new facilities in another location, rather than expanding at Morganton for future requirements due to ever increasing enrollment.; and WHEREAS, in order to provide the physical plant for an initial enroll- ment of one hundred -100 deaf students from preschool age through Grade 8 and the expansion to a student body of two hundred and fifty -250 with education through high school, when recommended by the Board of Directors two million fifty-seven thousand dollars ($2,057,000.00) would be required for capital improvements and renovations to the aforesaid buildings: Now, therefore, The General Assembly of North Carolina do enact:

Sec. 1 That Chapter 116 of the General Statutes, as amended, is hereby further amended by adding thereto a new Article which shall be designated as Article 20 and shall read as follows: Article 20 Eastern North Carolina School for the Deaf Sec. 116-186. Incorporation and location. There is hereby established and there shall be maintained a school for the deaf of this State which shall be a corporation under the corporate name of the Eastern North Carolina School for the Deaf. 1270 As soon as practicable after its appointment as hereinafter provided for the North Carolina Directors of Schools for the Deaf shall meet with the Governor and consider sites, including the proposed site at Wilson, North Carolina, together with any other sites in Eastern North Carolina which may be offered as a location for the school. From all sites offered, the Governor and the North Carolina Directors of Schools for the Deaf shall designate that site considered most suitable as the location for the Eastern North Carolina School for the Deaf, and such school shall thereafter be known as the North Carolina School for the Deaf at ............ Sec. 116-187. Directors; terms; vacancies. The North Carolina School for the Deaf at Morganton and the Eastern North Carolina School for the Deaf shall be under the control and management of a board of directors consisting of eleven -11 members known as North Carolina Directors of Schools for the Deaf. The said board of directors, to be known as North Carolina Directors of Schools for the Deaf, shall be constituted and composed as follows: The Governor of North Carolina, within thirty days after the effective date of this Act, shall appoint eleven -11 members or directors for terms of four -4 years each from and after the date of their appointment, and these eleven -11 members shall constitute the North Carolina Directors of Schools for the Deaf. All directors appointed as herein provided shall hold office until their successors are appointed and qualified. The Governor of North Carolina shall fill all vacancies in office of said directors arising because of death, resignation or any reason whatsoever. As soon as the Governor of North Carolina has appointed all directors, as herein provided, to serve as North Carolina Directors of Schools for the Deaf, the Board of Directors of the North Carolina School for the Deaf at Morganton shall cease to exist and the general control, administration and supervision of the Eastern North Carolina School for the Deaf and the North Carolina School for the Deaf at Morganton shall be under the authority of the North Carolina Directors of Schools for the Deaf as herein constituted. The Governor shall transmit to the General Assembly at its next regular Session the names of his appointees for confirmation but the appointees of the Governor shall have the right to serve and act as said directors until their names are presented to the General Assembly for confirmation. The Governor shall have the power to remove any member of the board of directors whenever in his opinion it is to the best interest of the State to remove such person, and the Governor shall not be required to give any reason for such removal. Sec. 116-188. Organization of board; other officials; salaries. The board of directors shall organize by appointing one of its number president and three an executive committee, who shall hold office for two years; they shall elect a superintendent for each school whose terms of office shall be three years, and such other officers, teachers, and agents as shall be deemed necessary, and shall fix the compensation of same. Sec. 116-189. Superintendent. The superintendents shall be teachers of knowledge, skill, and ability in their profession and experience in the management and instruction of the deaf. They shall possess good execu- 1271 tive ability and shall be the chief executive officers of the institutions. They shall devote their whole time to the supervision of the institution, and shall see that the pupils are properly instructed in the branches of learning and industrial pursuits as provided for in this Article, and under the supervision of the board. The board shall elect all teachers and subordinate officers by and with the consent and recommendation of the superintendents. Sec. 116-190. Pupils admitted; education. The board of directors shall, according to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, on application, receive into the school for the purposes of education all white deaf children resident of the State not of confirmed immoral character, nor imbecile or unsound in mind or incapacitated by physical infirmity for useful instruction, who are between the ages of six and twenty-one years: Provided, that the board of directors may admit students under the age of six years when, in its judgment, such admission will be for the best interest of the applicant and the facilities of the school permit such admission. Only those who are bona fide citizens and/or residents of North Carolina shall be eligible to and entitled to receive free tuition and maintenance. The board of directors may fix charges and prescribe rules whereby nonresident deaf children may be admitted, but in no event shall the admission of nonresidents in any way prevent the attendance of any eligible deaf child, resident of North Carolina. The board shall provide for the instruction of all pupils in the branches of study now prescribed by law for the public schools of the State and in such other branches as may be of special benefit to the deaf. As soon as practicable, the boys shall be instructed and trained in such mechanical pursuits as may be suited to them, and in practical agriculture and subjects relating thereto; and the girls shall be instructed in sewing, housekeeping, and such arts and industrial branches as may be useful to them in making themselves self-supporting.
