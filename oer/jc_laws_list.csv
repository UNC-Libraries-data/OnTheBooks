After receiving the advice of the committeemen and trustees, the county board of education shall have authority to adopt a county-wide plan of organization, and no districts or parts of any district, including non-local tax, local tax, and special charter districts, hereafter referred to in this article, shall be consolidated or the boundary lines changed, unless the consolidation or the change of boundary lines is in accordance with the adopted county-wide plan of organization: Provided, that in the event the county board of education deems it wise to modify or change the adopted plan, the board shall notify the committeemen and interested patrons and give them a hearing, if they desire to be heard, before any changes shall be made. 3 The county board of education shall have authority to execute the entire plan or any part of the same, but the county board of education shall have no authority to create a debt for the execution of any part of the proposed plan, unless authorized by law, and if the amount necessary to put into operation all or any part of said plan shall be greater than the amount that may be reasonably expected from the Operating and Equipment Fund for this purpose, the amount shall be guaranteed by the districts affected by the execution of the plan, or if the districts do not guarantee the funds the county board of education shall lay the proposed plan before the county commissioners, together with the estimated amount necessary to put the same into operation, and if the amount necessary to carry out all or any part of the proposed plan shall be approved by the county commissioners, the county board of education shall then have the authority to organize the districts in accordance with the county-wide plan. 4, When the proposed county-wide plan is adopted the county board shall notify the committeemen and boards of trustees as to what part of the plan the board proposes to carry out first and in what order the other parts of the plan will be considered, and the preference shall be given to those districts in which the needs are greatest if the funds for providing the equipment are made available. 5 In the event that any child or children of any district or any part of a district are without adequate school advantages, and these advantages may be improved by transferring said child or children to a school or schools in adjoining districts, the county board shall have authority to make such a transfer. But this shall not empower the county board of education to abolish or divide a district unless such act shall be in harmony with the county-wide plan of organization. The temporary transfer of such child or children may be made until such time as the countywide plan will provide more advantageously for them."

The classification of male prisoners shall apply to female prisoners so far as it relates to commutation of time and pay for their work. Honor men may be worked wherever any work is being carried on by the prison, provided their privileges and immunities as set forth in this section are in no wise abridged. 7724 Assignment to classes and changes. Persons sentenced to the penitentiary, or State Prison Department, for the first time shall be placed in the first or second class, but the assignment of a prisoner to any one of the three classes referred to in this article shall not be considered to mean that such prisoner must remain in such class, but a prisoner may be changed from a lower to a higher class or from a higher to a lower class, depending upon his behavior, and it is the purpose and intent of this section to direct the board of directors of the State Prison to encourage and assist the men to improve themselves that they can be transferred from a lower to a higher class or grade. 7725 Commutation of time. The men of the first class shall be allowed a commutation of their sentence of one hundred and four days for each year served, and the men of the second class shall be allowed a commutation of their sentence of seventy-eight days for each year they serve, and the men of the third class shall be allowed a commutation of their sentence of fifty-two days for each year they serve.

It is the duty of the several judicial officers of the State, in assigning any person to work the public roads of any county, to designate in each judgment that such as may be convicted of a felony shall wear felons stripes, and such as are convicted of a misdemeanor shall not wear felons stripes. In order to carry into effect the provisions of this section, the State Prison Board shall prescribe a uniform to be worn by persons convicted of felony, and a uniform to be worn by persons convicted of a misdemeanor which shall be different and easily distinguished from the uniform of the felon; but the board of directors of the State Prison Department or other governing authority may in their discretion allow prisoners sentenced for misdemeanor only to wear clothes similar to that worn by the ordinary citizen. The board of commissioners of the respective counties in which convicts are worked on the public roads shall provide uniforms of each kind, except in those cases exempted in this section. 7731 Violation as to work in felons uniform; officer liable. It shall be unlawful to work persons convicted of a felony in other than the uniform of a felon, or to clothe a person convicted of a misdemeanor in the uniform of a felon. Any superintendent of convicts or other persons in authority who shall violate this law shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and fined or imprisoned, or both, in the discretion of the court; and, moreover, be liable in damage to the party aggrieved, to be recovered in a civil action, which may be brought in either the county from which the party was sentenced or the county in which the wrong was done. - 7732 Recreation and instruction of prisoners.

In all counties having had a new countywide registration of voters, either in the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty-six or one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight, the said chairman in said county is authorized to transfer to the new registration books the names of all persons registered therein regardless of whether any of the persons so registered voted in either of said elections or primary elections of one thousand nine hundred and thirty-six or one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight, except that the chairman shall remove from the books the names of all persons known by the chairman to have died or moved their voting residence elsewhere since said registration was held: Provided, however, that if the registration books in those counties having had a new registration within the time above mentioned do not show the party affiliation of the voter together with the other required information then the chairman shall order a new registration therein. In instances where the party affiliation is shown part of the time and is not shown in some cases, then the procedure set forth in the third section of this Act shall be followed: Provided, further, that in those counties having had a new county-wide registration of voters either in the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty-six or one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight, which registration, revision and relisting of voters was performed in substantial compliance with the terms of this Act, in the opinion of the Chairman of the State Board of Elections the said chairman will not be required to comply with the terms and provisions of this Act."

For the purpose of preserving and promoting the public health and welfare the State Board of Health may, as hereinafter provided, create sanitary districts without regard for county, township or municipal lines: Provided, however, that no municipal corporation or any part of the territory in a municipal corporation shall be included in a sanitary district except at the request of the governing board of such municipal corporation; provided further that if such municipal corporation shall not have levied any tax nor performed any official act nor held any elections within a period of four years next preceding the date of the petition for said sanitary district, as hereinafter provided, such a request of the governing board shall not be required. 130-124. Procedure for Incorporating District. A sanitary district shall be incorporated as hereinafter set out. Fifty-one per cent -51% or more of the freeholders within a proposed sanitary district may petition the board of county commissioners of the county in which all or the major portion of the petitioning freeholders of the proposed district are located, setting forth the boundaries of the proposed sanitary district and the objects it is proposed to accomplish. Upon receipt of such petition the board of county commissioners, through its chairman, shall notify the State Board of Health and the chairman of the board of county commissioners of any other county or counties in which any portion of the proposed district lies, of the receipt of said petition, and shall request that a representative of the State Board of Health hold a joint public hearing with the county commissioners of all the counties in which a portion of the district lies concerning the creation of the proposed sanitary district. The State Health Director and the chairman of the board of county commissioners shall name a time and place within the proposed district at which the public hearing shall be held. The chairman of the board of county commissioners shall give prior notice of such hearing by posting a notice at the courthouse door of the county and also by publication in a newspaper published in said county at least once a week for four successive weeks; and in the event such hearing is to be before a joint meeting of the boards of county commissioners of more than one county, or in the event the land to be affected lies in more than one county, then a like publication and notice shall be made and given in each of said counties. In the event that all matters pertaining to the creation of this sanitary district cannot be concluded at the hearing, any such hearing may be continued to a time and place within the proposed district named by the representative of the State Board of Health, 1498 130-125. Declaration that District Exists; Status of Industrial Villages within Boundaries of District. If, after such hearing the State Board of Health and the county commissioners concerned shall deem it advisable to comply with the request of said petition, and determine that a district for the purpose or purposes therein stated should be created and established, and State Board of Health shall adopt a resolution to that effect, defining the boundaries of such district and declaring the territory within such boundaries to be a sanitary district; provided that the State Board of Health may make minor deviation, in defining the boundaries, from those prescribed in the petition when the Board determines that it is advisable in the interest of the public health; provided further that any industrial plant and its contiguous village shall be included within or excluded from the areas embraced within such sanitary district as expressed in the application of the person, persons or corporation owning or controlling such industrial plant and its contiguous village, said application to be filed with the State Board of Health on or before the date of the public hearing as hereinbefore provided. Each district when created shall be identified by a name or number assigned by the State Board of Health. 1380-126. Election and Terms of Office of Sanitary District Boards. The State Board of Health shall cause copies of the resolution adopted creating the sanitary district to be sent to the board or boards of county commissioners of the county or counties in which all or parts of the territory within the district is located, whereupon the said board or boards of county commissioners shall hold a meeting or joint meeting for the purpose of electing a sanitary district board of three members, residents within the district, which shall thereafter be the governing body of the sanitary district. At this meeting or joint meeting of said board or boards of county commissioners there shall be elected three members of said sanitary district boards who shall serve until their successors are elected and qualified. At the next general election following said appointment by the board of county commissioners, candidates for said district board shall be nominated in the primary and elected at the general election as are county officers, except that the nomination and election shall be confined to said district. When more than six candidates qualify for a primary, then the six candidates receiving the highest number of votes in the primary shall be nominated as candidates for election in the general election, and the three candidates receiving the highest number of votes in the general election shall be elected as members of said sanitary district board. When six or less candidates qualify for the primary, then each shall be declared to be a candidate in the general election without their names being voted upon in the primary. The primary and general election shall be nonpartisan, and each shall be conducted by the board of elections in the county in which the sanitary district is located. The said board of elections is authorized and empowered to cause a special election to be held at such time or times as it may designate, if necessary to break a tie between any candidate in the primary or general election: Provided, that this paragraph shall apply only to sanitary districts located wholly within the limits of a single 1499 county, and which adjoin and are contiguous to cities having a population of fifty thousand or more. The said board of elections shall canvass the returns from any primary or general election and within ten days thereafter certify the results thereof to the Clerk of the Superior Court. The Clerk of the Superior Court in each county is authorized, directed and empowered to take and file the oaths of office of those persons elected. Prior to the appointment of a sanitary district board by the board or boards of county commissioners or prior to the election of the members of a sanitary district board at any general election, the board or boards of county commissioners may by resolution determine that such sanitary district board shall consist of five members, residents within such district. In such case, when more than ten candidates for membership on such sanitary district board qualify for a primary, then the ten candidates receiving the highest number of votes in the primary shall be nominated as candidates for election in the next general election, and the five candidates receiving the highest number of votes in the general election shall be elected as members of said sanitary district board; when ten or less candidates qualify for the primary, then each shall be declared to be a candidate in the general election without his name being voted upon in the primary. The primary and general election shall be nonpartisan, and each shall be conducted by the board of elections in the county in which the greater portion of the qualified voters of the sanitary district are located. The said board of elections is authorized and empowered to cause a special election to be held at such time or times as it may designate, if necessary to break a tie between any candidates in the primary or general election. The members of the board so nominated and elected shall be residents of the district. They shall qualify by taking the oaths of office on the first Monday in December following their election. The term of office shall be two years and until their successors qualify. 130-127. Vacancy Appointments to District Boards.

A sanitary district may keep in the office of the secretary of the sanitary district board, or in the office of a bank or trust company appointed by said board as bond registrar or transfer agent, a register or registers for the registration and transfer of its bonds, in which it may register any bond at the time of its issue or, at the request of the holder, thereafter. After such registration, the principal and interest of the bond shall be payable to the person in whose name it is registered except in the case of a coupon bond registered as to principal only, in which case the principal shall be payable to such person, unless the bond shall be discharged from registration by being registered as payable to bearer. After registration a bond may be transferred on such register by the registered owner in person or by attorney, upon presentation to the bond registrar, accompanied by delivery of a written instrument of transfer in a form approved by the bond registrar, executed by the registered owner. Upon the registration or transfer of a bond as aforesaid, the bond registrar shall note such registration or transfer on the bank of the bond. A sanitary district may, by recital in its bonds, agree to register the bonds as to principal only, or agree to register them either as to principal only or as to both principal and interest at the option of the bondholder. Upon the registration of a coupon bond as to both 1510 principal and interest the bond registrar shall also cut off and cancel the coupons, and endorse upon the back of such bond a statement that such coupons have been canceled. The proceeds from the sale of such bonds shall be placed in a bank in the State of North Carolina to the credit of the sanitary district board, and payments therefrom shall be made by vouchers signed by the chairman and secretary of the sanitary district board. The officer or officers having charge or custody of funds of the district shall require said bank to furnish security for the protection of deposits of the district as provided in G. S. 159-28. Bonds issued for any purpose pursuant to this Article shall mature within the period of years as hereinafter provided, each such period being computed from the date of the election upon the issuance thereof held under the provisions of G. S. 130-137. Such periods shall be for the purposes stated by clauses in G. S. 130-1384 as follows: Clause (a), forty years; clause (b), twenty years; clause (c), ten years. Such bonds shall mature in annual installments or series, the first of which shall be made payable not more than five years after the date of the first issued bonds of such issue, and the last within the aforesaid period. No such installment or series shall be more than two and one-half times as great in amount as the smallest prior installment or series of the same bond issue. If all of the bonds of any issue are not issued at the same time, the bonds at any one time outstanding shall mature as aforesaid. Such bonds may be issued either all at one time or from time to time in blocks, and different provisions may be made for different blocks. Bonds issued pursuant to this Article shall be subject to the provisions of the Local Government Act. The cost of preparing, issuing, and marketing bonds shall be deemed to be one of the purposes for which the bonds are issued. 130-189. Additional Bonds. Whenever the proceeds from the sale of bonds issued by any district as in this Article authorized shall have been expended or contracted to be expended and the sanitary district board shall determine that the interest or necessity of the district demands that additional bonds are necessary for carrying out any of the objects of the district, the board may again proceed as in this Article provided to cause an election to be held for the issuance of such additional bonds and the issue and sale of such bonds and the expenditure of the proceeds therefrom shall be carried out as hereinbefore provided. In the event the proceeds of the sale of the bonds shall be in excess of the amount necessary for the purpose for which they were issued, such excess shall be applied to the payment of principal and interest of said bonds. 130-140. Funding or Refunding Bonds. A sanitary district may issue its negotiable funding or refunding bonds for the purpose of funding or refunding valid indebtedness of the sanitary district if such debt be payable at the time of the passage of the bond resolution authorizing bonds to fund or refund such debt, or be payable within one year thereafter, or if such debt, although payable more than one year thereafter, is to be cancelled prior to its maturity and simultaneously with the issuance of the bonds to fund or refund such debt. The word indebtedness or debt as used in this 1511 Section includes the principal of bonds, certificates of indebtedness and revenue anticipation notes, and includes the principal of funding bonds, refunding bonds and other evidences of indebtedness heretofore or hereafter issued pursuant to this Article. All such funding or refunding bonds shall be authorized by a bond resolution passed by the sanitary district board, which bond resolution shall state: 1 In brief and general terms the purpose for which the bonds are to be issued, including a brief description of the indebtedness to be funded or refunded sufficiently to identify such indebtedness. 2 The maximum aggregate principal amount of the bonds. 3 That a tax sufficient to pay the principal and interest of the bonds when due shall be annually levied and collected on all taxable property within the sanitary district. 4, That the resolution shall take effect upon its passage and shall not be submitted to the voters. Such bond resolution shall be published once a week for three successive weeks and a statement substantially in the form provided by G. S. 130-134 above shall be published with the bond resolution. Such funding or refunding bonds shall mature at any time or times, not later than forty years from their date. 180-141. Valuation of Property; Determining Annual Revenue Needed. Upon the creation of a sanitary district and after each assessment for taxes thereafter the board or boards of county commissioners of the county or counties in which the sanitary district is located shall file with the sanitary district board the valuation of assessable property within the district. The sanitary district board shall then determine the amount of funds to be raised for the ensuing year in excess of the funds available from surplus operating revenues set aside as provided in G. S. 1380-144 below to provide payment of interest and the proportionate part of the principal of all outstanding bonds, and retire all outstanding certificates of indebtedness, revenue anticipation notes issued against the district and to pay all obligations incurred by the district in the performance of its lawful undertakings. The sanitary district board shall determine the number of cents per one hundred dollars ($100.00) necessary to raise the said amount and so certify to the board or boards of county commissioners. The board or boards of county commissioners in their next annual levy shall include the number of cents per one hundred dollars ($100.00) so certified by the sanitary district board in the levy against all taxable property within the district, which tax shall be collected as other county taxes are collected and every month the amount of tax so collected shall be remitted to the sanitary district board and deposited by the said board in a bank in the State of North Carolina separately from other funds of the district. The officer or officers having charge or custody of the funds of the district shall require said bank to furnish security for protection of such deposits as provided in G. S. 159-28. 1512 The sanitary district board of any sanitary district, in lieu of collecting the taxes in the manner as hereinbefore provided, may cause to be listed by all the taxpayers residing within the district with the person designated by the district board, all the taxable property located within the district, and after determining the amount of funds to be raised for the ensuing year in excess of the funds available from surplus operating revenues set aside as provided in G. S. 130-144 to provide payment of interest and the proportionate part of the principal of all outstanding bonds, certificates of indebtedness, revenue anticipation notes issued against the district and to pay all obligations incurred by the district in the performance of all of its lawful undertakings, to determine the number of cents per one hundred dollars ($100.00) necessary to raise said amount. The said sanitary district board in its next annual levy shall levy against all taxable property in the district the number of cents per one hundred dollars ($100.00) necessary to raise the amount with which to pay the obligations of the district, including principal and interest on bonds, certificates of indebtedness, revenue anticipation notes and other lawful obligations of the district, which tax shall be collected in the same manner as taxes of other political subdivisions of the State of North Carolina are collected by a tax collector, to be selected by the sanitary district board of the sanitary district electing to assess, levy and collect its taxes in the manner herein provided. The tax collector selected by said sanitary district board and the depository, in which said taxes so collected are deposited, shall qualify in the same manner and give the necessary surety bonds as are required of tax collectors and depositories of county funds in the county or counties in which said sanitary districts are located. 130-142. Certificates of Indebtedness in Anticipation of Taxes; Loans under Local Government Act. A sanitary district board may issue certificates of indebtedness in anticipation of the levying and collection of taxes to cover any or all expenses incurred by the board incident to the preparation of the engineers report, holding of bond election or any other expenses incurred by the board. The amount of any certificates of indebtedness issued by the sanitary district board shall be included in the bond issue as hereinbefore provided. In the event that the election held within the district for the purpose of issuing bonds to provide funds for carrying out the objects of the district results in the defeat of said bonds the sanitary district board shall cause to be levied and collected a tax sufficient to pay such certificates of indebtedness or any other indebtedness incurred by the sanitary district board. Such tax shall be levied and collected in the same manner as provided in G. S. 130-141. A sanitary district board may borrow money under the provisions of the Local Government Act, for the purpose of paying appropriations made for the current fiscal year in anticipation of the collection of the taxes and other revenues of such fiscal year, payable at such time or times, not later than thirty days after the expiration of the current fiscal year, as the governing board may fix. No such loans shall be made if the amount thereof, together with the amount of similar previous loans remaining un- 1513 paid, shall exceed fifty per cent -50% of the amount of uncollected taxes and other revenue for the fiscal year in which the loan is made, as estimated by the chief financial officer and certified in writing by him to the governing body. 130-148. Engineers to Provide Plans and Supervise Work; Bids. The sanitary district board shall retain competent engineers to provide detail plans and specifications and to supervise the doing of the work undertaken by the district. As determined by the sanitary district board, such work or any portion thereof, may be done by the sanitary district board purchasing the material and letting a contract for the doing of the work or by letting a contract for furnishing all the material and the doing of the work. Any contract shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder submitting a sealed bid in response to a notice calling for such bid and published at least five times over a period of at least fifteen days in a newspaper or newspapers having a general circulation within the county or counties in which the district is located. Any material to be purchased by the sanitary district board, the cost of which is in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), shall be purchased from the lowest responsible bidder in the same manner as above provided. All work done shall be in accordance with the plans and specifications prepared by the engineers in conformity with the plan adopted by the sanitary district board. 130-144. Service Charges and Rates. A sanitary district board shall immediately upon the placing into service of any of its works apply service charges and rates which shall, as nearly as practicable, be based upon the exact benefits derived. Such service charges and rates shall be sufficient to provide funds for the proper maintenance, adequate depreciation, and operation of the work of the district, and provided said service charges and rates would not thereby be made unreasonable, to include in said service charges and rates an amount sufficient to pay the principal and interest maturing on the outstanding bonds of the district and thereby make the project self-liquidating. Any surplus from operating revenues shall be set aside as a separate fund to be applied to the payment of interest on bonds, to the retirement of bonds or both. As the necessity arises the sanitary district board may modify and adjust such service charges and rates from time to time. 130-145. Removal of Member of Board. A petition carrying the signatures of twenty-five per cent -25% or more of the legal voters within a sanitary district requesting the removal from office of one or more members of a sanitary district board for malfeasance or nonfeasance in office may be filed with the board of county commissioners of the county in which all or the greater portion of the legal voters of a sanitary district are located. Upon receipt of such petition the board of county commissioners or, in the event that the district is located in more than one county, a joint meeting of the boards of county commissioners shall be called, shall adopt a resolution calling an election, naming election officials, naming a date, and giving due notice thereof for the purpose of removing from office the mem- 1514 ber or members of the sanitary district board named in the petition. In the event that more than one member of a sanitary district board is subjected to recall in an election, the names of each member of the board subjected to recall shall appear upon separate ballots. If in such recall election, a majority of the legal votes within the sanitary district shall be cast for the removal of any member or members of the sanitary district board subject to recall, such member or members shall cease to be a member or members of the sanitary district board, and the vacancy or vacancies so caused shall be immediately filled as hereinbefore provided. The expense of holding a recall election shall be paid from the funds of the sanitary district. 130-146. Rights-of-Way Granted.

Procedure for Extension of District. The boundaries of any sanitary district may, with the approval of the sanitary district board, be extended under the same procedure as herein provided for the creation of a sanitary district: Provided, that ten per cent -10% of the freeholders resident in the district to be annexed are authorized to petition for an election upon the subject of annexation, and if such petition is filed with the sanitary district board, such election shall be held within the territory to be annexed under the rules and regulations hereinbefore provided. However, if the owners of all of the real property in the territory to be annexed petition any sanitary district board to include such real property within the boundaries of said district, then and in that event no election shall be necessary and such sanitary district board is authorized and empowered to enlarge its boundaries so as to include such property in the district upon the approval of its actions by the board of county commissioners of any county or counties within which said sanitary district lies, and with the further approval of the State Board of Health. In any case where the boundaries of a sanitary district shall have been extended and the proposition of issuing bonds of the district as enlarged shall not be approved by the voters at an election held within one year subsequent to such extension, fifty-one per cent -51% or more of the resident freeholders within the territory so annexed may, with the approval of the sanitary district board, petition the board of commissioners of the 1515 county in which the annexed territory is located, that the territory so annexed be disconnected and excluded from such sanitary district. Upon receipt of such petition the board of commissioners shall, through its chairman, transmit the petition to the State Board of Health requesting that the petition be granted. If, after a hearing, conducted under the same procedure as provided in G. S. 130-124 for the creation of sanitary districts, and after publication of notice thereof in the district, the State Board of Health shall deem it advisable to comply with the request of said petition, the State Board of Health shall adopt a resolution to that effect, and shall define the boundaries of the district, which shall be the boundaries of the district as it existed before the extension. 130-149. District and Municipality Extending Boundaries and Corporate Limits Simultaneously. Whenever the boundaries of a sanitary district lie wholly within or are coterminous with the corporate limits of a city or town and such sanitary district provides the only public water supply and sewage disposal system for such city or town, the boundaries of such sanitary district and the corporate limits of such city or town may, if and when extended, be extended simultaneously in the following manner: Twenty-five per cent -25% or more of the resident freeholders within the territory proposed to be annexed to the sanitary district and to the city or town may petition the sanitary district board and the governing board of the city or town setting forth the boundaries of the area proposed to be annexed and the objects it is proposed to accomplish, which petition may also include any area already within the corporate limits of the city or town but not already within the boundaries of the sanitary district. Upon receipt of such petition the sanitary district board and the governing board of the city or town shall meet jointly, and before passing upon the petition shall hold a public hearing upon the same and shall give prior notice of such hearing by posting a notice at the courthouse door of their county and also by publishing a notice at least once a week for four successive weeks in a newspaper published in said county. If at or after the public hearing the sanitary district board and the governing board of the city or town, acting jointly and with the approval of the State Board of Health, shall each approve the petition, then the question shall be submitted to a vote of all of the qualified voters in the area or areas proposed to be annexed and in the sanitary district and in the city or town, voting as a whole. Such election to be held on a date approved by the sanitary district board and by the governing board of the city or town. At such election the qualified voters who present themselves to the election officials at the respective voting places shall be furnished with ballots upon which shall be written or printed the words For Extension and Against Extension, and if at such election a majority of all the votes cast be For Extension, then from and after the date of the declaration of the result of such election the territory and its citizens and property shall be subject to all debts, ordinances, and regulations in force in said sanitary district and in said city or town, and shall be entitled to the same privileges and benefits as other parts of said sanitary district and said city or town. 1516 The newly annexed territory shall be subject to the sanitary district and the city or town taxes levied for the fiscal year following the date of such annexation. If at such election a majority of all the votes cast be Against Extension then there shall be no extension of either the boundaries of the sanitary district or the corporate limits of the city or town. The costs of holding and conducting such election for annexation, as herein provided, shall be paid one-half -4% by the sanitary district and one-half -4% by the city or town. Except as herein otherwise provided, when ordered by the sanitary district board and the governing board of the city or town acting jointly, the board of elections of the county in which the sanitary district and the city or town are located, shall call, hold, conduct and determine the result of such election, according to the provisions of Section 160-448 of the General Statutes. In any cases where the boundaries of a sanitary district and the corporate limits of a city or town are extended as herein provided, and the proposition of issuing bonds of the sanitary district as enlarged, in order to provide adequate facilities for the annexed area or areas, as may be determined by the sanitary district board, shall not be approved by the voters at an election held within one year subsequent to such extension, the territory so annexed may be disconnected and excluded from such sanitary district in the manner provided by G. S. 1380-148; and if the territory so annexed is disconnected and excluded from such sanitary district it shall automatically and without any further procedure or action of any kind whatsoever be disconnected and excluded from such city or town, provided, however, if the petition also includes areas within the present corporate limits of the city or town but not within the present boundaries of the sanitary district, such areas already within the corporate limits of the city or town shall not be disconnected or excluded from such city or town under the provisions of this Section. The powers granted by this Section shall be supplemental and additional to powers conferred by any other law and shall not be regarded as in derogation to any powers now existing. 130-150. Procedure for Withdrawing from District. In any sanitary district created under the provisions of this Article which has no outstanding indebtedness, fifty-one per cent -51% or more of the resident freeholders of a portion of any such sanitary district, with the approval of the sanitary district board, may petition the county commissioners of the county in which a major portion of the petitioners reside, that said portion of the district be disconnected and excluded from the said district and dissolved. If the board of county commissioners approves the petition, they shall submit to the residents of the entire district, at an election duly called for that purpose, the question of whether or not the portion of the district petitioning to be excluded shall be excluded. If a majority of those voting at said election vote to allow the petitioning portion of the district to be excluded, the county commissioners shall transmit that fact to the State 1517 Board of Health who shall exclude said portion of the district, dissolve said portion, and redefine the limits accordingly. 130-151. Dissolution of Certain Sanitary Districts. In any sanitary district established under this Chapter which has no outstanding indebtedness, fifty-one per cent -51% or more of the resident freeholders therein may petition the board of commissioners of the county in which all or the greater portion of the resident free-holders of the district are located to dissolve said district. Upon receipt of such petition, the board of county commissioners through its chairman, shall notify the State Board of Health and the chairman of the board of county commissioners of any other county or counties in which any portion of the district lies, of the receipt of such petition, and shall request that a representative of the State Board of Health hold a joint public hearing with the said county commissioners concerning the dissolution of the district. The State Health Director and the chairman of the board of county commissioners shall name a time and place within the district at which the public hearing shall be held. The chairman of the board of county commissioners shall give prior notice of such hearing by posting a notice at the courthouse door of the county and also by publication in a newspaper published in said county at least once a week for four successive weeks; and in the event such hearing is to be before a joint meeting of the boards of county commissioners of more than one county, then a like publication and notice shall be made and given in each of said counties. In the event that all matters pertaining to the dissolution of the sanitary district cannot be concluded at the hearing, any such hearing may be continued to a time and place determined by the representative of the State Board of Health. If after such hearing, the State Board of Health and the county commissioners concerned shall deem it advisable to comply with the request of said petition, the State Board of Health shall adopt a resolution to that effect, whereupon the district shall be deemed dissolved. 130-152.

ARTICLE 6 ROADS AND STREETS Sec. 6.51. Establishment of Proposed Street Lines. Whenever, in the opinion of the city council, it is for the best interest of the city that any street should be widened or extended, or both, or that a new street should be opened, the council may pass an ordinance declaring that such street should be widened or extended, or both, or that such new street should be opened, and shall lay out in the ordinance the lines within which such street should be widened, extended, or opened. If any street under the provision of such ordinance is to be widened, it need not be widened on both sides; and, if it is to be widened on both sides, the distance to be widened on both sides need not be the same. Any ordinance introduced for the purpose of widening, extending, or opening any street under the provisions of this charter, may not be adopted until the proposed ordinance is published in a newspaper published in the city and qualified to carry legal notices at least two times, on separate days at least ten days before the passage of the ordinance, or, if there be no such newspaper, posted in three public places in the city. There shall be posted or published with the ordinance a notice stating when property owners may be heard by the council. A public hearing on the question of the adoption of such ordinance shall be held prior to the passage of the ordinance. Sec. 6.52. Notice to City Required before Improvement. After the passage of such ordinance, it shall be unlawful for any land within the proposed street lines established by such ordinance to be built upon or improved, or for any part of any existing building within said lines to be repaired or otherwise improved until the city shall have first been given an opportunity to purchase or otherwise acquire said property for street purposes as provided in this charter. To that end, any person proposing to build upon such land or to make repairs or improvements to that part of any existing building situated thereon shall, in writing, notify the city council of the nature and estimated cost of such building, repairs, or improvements. The council shall then determine whether it will take the necessary steps to acquire said land prior to the construction of said 1254 building or the making of such repairs or improvements, and if it fails within sixty days from date of receipt of said notice to acquire, or to institute condemnation proceedings to acquire, said property, the owner or other person giving such notice may proceed to erect the building in accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the city, or to make the repairs or improvements described in said notice. Sec. 6.53. Failure to Give Notice Bars Recovery. If any person, firm, or corporation builds upon any land included within proposed street lines, or repairs or otherwise improves that part of any existing building within proposed street lines without giving the city an opportunity to acquire said land free from said improvements, as provided in the preceding Section, the city shall not be required to pay for the value of the building, repairs, or improvements in any proceeding subsequently brought to acquire said land for the purpose set out in said Section. Sec. 6.54. Acquisition of Land. If upon receiving any notice in compliance with Section 6.52, the city council determines to acquire said land immediately, it may acquire the same by grant, purchase, or condemnation. In no case shall an effort to purchase said land be necessary to the institution of condemnation proceedings. If the council determines to proceed by condemnation, the condemnation shall be as set forth in this charter. Sec. 6.55. Cost of Land Acquired for Street Widening to be Assessed as Part of Improvement. After any land has been purchased or condemned for the purpose of widening, extending, or opening any street, and the land purchased or condemned lies within the limits of an improvement directed in said proceeding, then the amount paid by the city for the land purchased or condemned, together with the cost of the condemnation proceeding and interest on said amount paid and costs at the rate of six per cent per annum from the date of payment, shall be included in the cost of said improvement and shall be assessed as provided by law against the property to be assessed for the improvements. Sec. 6.56. Exercise of Condemnation Power after Failure to Condemn Following Notice. The failure of the city to acquire any land within thirty days after receiving notice that the same is to be built upon, or that a building thereon is to be repaired or otherwise improved, or its failure within said time to institute proceedings to condemn the same, shall not limit the right of the city at any subsequent time to condemn the same; but in such case the owner shall be entitled to compensation as now provided by law for the building, repairs, or improvements made after the giving of the required notice and the failure of the city to acquire said land free of said improvements. Sec. 6.61. Power to Close Streets. (a) The city council shall have the power to close any street or portion thereof that is now or may hereafter be opened or dedicated, either by the recording of a subdivision plat or otherwise. Upon receipt of a sufficient petition signed by the owners of a majority of the property abutting a 1255 street, requesting that it be closed, and after an investigation of the sufficiency of the petition by the city attorney, the city clerk shall publish a notice of a public hearing to be held by the council, such publication to be once a week for four successive weeks in some newspaper published in the city which is qualified to carry legal notices, or if there be no such newspaper, by posting a notice at three public places in the city. Any individuals owning property abutting a street who do not join in the request for closing the street shall be notified by registered letter of the time and place of the public hearing. If it appears to the satisfaction of the city council that the closing of the street is not contrary to the public interest, and that no individual owning property in the vicinity of the street or in the subdivision in which it is located will thereby be deprived of reasonable means of ingress or egress to his property, the city council may order the closing of the street; provided, that any person aggrieved may appeal within thirty days from the order of the council to the Superior Court of Guilford County, where the question shall be heard de novo. Upon such an appeal, the Superior Court shall have full jurisdiction to decide the matter upon the issues arising and to order the street closed upon proper finding of fact by a jury. A certified copy of the order of the council (or the judgment of the Superior Court in the event of an appeal) shall be filed in the office of the Register of Deeds of Guilford County. Upon the closing of a street in accordance with the provisions of this Section, all right, title, and interest in the portion of the street closed shall be conclusively presumed to be vested in the owners of the lots or parcels of land abutting the portion of the street closed, and the title of each of such owners shall, for the width of the abutting land owned by such persons, extend to the center of the street. Copies of the registered letters giving the notice required by this Section, and the return receipts or other good and sufficient evidence of the giving of the required notice, shall be recorded in the register of deeds office, together with the resolution of the council (or with the judgment of the Superior Court, in cases where an appeal was taken). No final action shall be taken by the city council to close a street until the matter has been referred to the Greensboro Planning Board for study and recommendations, but no public hearing shall be necessary before the Greensboro Planning Board. i (b) The resolution ordering the closing of a street may provide for utility rights-of-way to be retained by the city or public utility company, if needed. ARTICLE 7 WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND WASTE DISPOSAL AND OTHER UTILITIES Sec. 6.81. Operation of Water Systems, Sewerage and Waste Disposal Systems, and Other Utilities. (a) The city council may: -1 Provide for the construction or acquisition and operation of utilities and utility systems; -2 Acquire any real or personal property necessary or incidental thereto, including equipment, machinery, and all manner of rights or interests in or relating to land and water, and appurtenances thereto; and 1256 -3 Establish rates of charge for utility services and for the use of utility facilities. (b) The city manager shall have the entire supervision and control of the management of all city utilities and utility systems. With the approval of the city council he may adopt rules and regulations: -1 Concerning the management of utility and utility systems, with regard to such matters as maintenance, operation, and improvement thereof, or requiring the pretreatment of waste; and -2 Concerning collection of charges for utility services and for the use of utility facilities. If pursuant to any rule or regulation utility service to any property is discontinued, it shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation without the city managers approval to renew a utility service or to use it without having first paid any outstanding charges and obtained the approval of the city manager. Violations of this paragraph shall be misdemeanors punishable by a fine of not exceeding fifty dollars ($50.00), or imprisonment for not exceeding thirty days. (c) As used in this charter, unless the context otherwise requires, the term utility includes water supply, water distribution, sewerage, waste disposal, electric power, gas, and public transportation utilities. Sec. 6.82. Water Connection by Abutting Owners. The city council may require that within thirty days after a water main or sewer main is completed and made ready for use, the owner of every abutting lot whereon water is supplied for any human use shall cause the lot to be connected to the water main or sewer main. Sec. 6.83. Liens for Utility Charges. In case any charge for utility service or for the use of utility facilities is not paid within ten days after it becomes due, the same shall become a lien upon the property served or in connection with which the service or facility is used. The charge may at any time thereafter be collected, either by suit in the name of the city or by the city tax collector for the city, by the sale of the property upon which the lien attaches at the Guilford County courthouse door, after advertising the sale once a week for four successive weeks in some newspaper published in the city which is qualified to carry legal notices. The sale shall be made under the same rules and regulations, and subject to the same costs and penalties and to the same rights of redemption as are provided by law for the foreclosure of the lien on real estate for taxes. SUBCHAPTER B. EMINENT DOMAIN AND LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS ARTICLE 1 EMINENT DOMAIN Sec. 6.101. Condemnation Procedure; Interest Acquired. The City of Greensboro shall possess the power of eminent domain, and may acquire, either by purchase or condemnation, any land, right of access, right-of-way, water right, privilege, easement, or any other interest in or relating to land or water, either within or beyond the city limits, including and limited to a right-of-way in and across lands owned or held as rightof-way by a railroad or other public utility company (provided that the 1257 operation of such railroad or other public utility company may not be impaired unreasonably thereby), for any lawful public use or purpose. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the condemnation resolution, a fee simple title shall pass to the city upon the condemnation of any such interest. In any case where the owner of land to be condemned or of any interest therein is a minor, an insane person, or otherwise under any disability, any notice hereinafter required by this Article to be served upon such owner shall be served upon his guardian, and service upon such guardian shall be sufficient without service on the minor, insane person, or person under disability. Thereafter such guardian may exercise on behalf of his ward with respect to such condemnation proceeding all the powers conferred upon such person as owner. Water rights or other interests relating to water may be condemned under the procedure set forth in this Article for the condemnation of land and interests therein. Sec. 6.102. Effort to Purchase Not Required. It shall not be necessary to the condemnation by the city of any land or interest therein, whether pursuant to this Article or otherwise, that the city shall have attempted to acquire the needed land by grant or purchase prior to the commencement of condemnation proceedings. Sec. 6.103. Resolution Proposing Condemnation. (a) When any land required by the city for any purpose allowed by this charter or the general law of the State is proposed to be condemned under the specific provisions of this charter, the city council shall adopt a resolution which shall contain substantially the following provisions: -1 A description of the land proposed to be condemned in fee, or of the interest or easement proposed to be condemned. -2 If there is any building or other property situated wholly or partly upon the land to be condemned, the determination of the city council as to whether the owner shall be allowed to remove such property or whether the same shall be condemned; -3 A statement of the purpose for which said land or easement is proposed to be condemned; -4 The name and address of the owner or owners of said land and of any other person or persons interested therein whom it is necessary to make a party to the proceeding; -5 The name of a disinterested freeholder of the city appointed as appraiser by the city council; -6 A notice that the owner or owners of said land, or interest therein, or a majority in interest of said owners, may, within fifteen days after service of said resolution upon all of them, appoint one appraiser (who shall be a disinterested freeholder of the city) to represent them, the name of which appraiser shall be reported in writing to the city clerk within said fifteen days; -7 A notice that the appraiser appointed by the city and the appraiser appointed by the owner or owners, or if the owner or owners fail to appoint, then the two appraisers appointed by the city, shall appoint a third appraiser, and that the three thus appointed shall constitute a board of 1258 appraisers, whose duty it shall be to determine the damages and benefits which will result from the condemnation of said land or easement or interest therein; -8 A notice of the time fixed for the first meeting of the appraisers, and that said meeting will be held upon the premises to be condemned. (b) It shall not be necessary to institute separate condemnation proceedings against the several owners of tracts or parcels of land affected by proposed local improvements. Sec. 6.104. Service of Resolution Proposing Condemnation. A copy of the resolution proposing condemnation shall be personally served upon each of the owners of the land proposed to be condemned; provided, that if the resolution cannot be personally served upon any of the owners, then it may be served by publication once a week for two successive weeks in some newspaper published in the city which is qualified to carry legal notices, or, if there be no such newspaper, by posting in three public places in the city. Sec. 6.105. Failure of Owners to Appoint Appraiser. If within fifteen days after service of the resolution upon all of the owners, they or a majority in interest of them fail to appoint an appraiser and to report his name to the city clerk, the city council shall appoint a disinterested freeholder of the city to represent them. Sec. 6.106. Appointment of Third Appraiser; Oath. The appraiser appointed by the city council, and the appraiser appointed by the owner or owners, or if the owner or owners fail to appoint, then the two appraisers appointed by the city council, shall appoint a third appraiser, who shall be a disinterested freeholder of the city, and shall report his name to the city clerk. Each appraiser shall take an oath or affirmation that he will fairly and impartially discharge his duties as an appraiser. Sec. 6.107. First Meeting of Appraisers. At the time fixed by the resolution of condemnation, the appraisers shall meet on the premises proposed to be condemned. If for any reason a meeting cannot be held at the time fixed by the city council, then a meeting shall be held at another time fixed by the appraisers, in which case notice of the time and place of the meeting shall be personally served upon each of the owners of the land or easement proposed to be condemned, or if the notice cannot be personally served, it may be served by publication once a week for two successive weeks in some newspaper published in the city which is qualified to carry legal notices, or, if there be no such newspaper, by posting in three public places in the city. The notice, whether given personally, by publication, or by posting, shall be served not less than five days prior to the date of the hearing. At the first meeting the appraisers shall view the premises affected by the proposed condemnation; and shall hear, but need not reduce to writing, any evidence as to damages and benefits that will result from the proposed condemnation presented by the owners or by the city. The appraisers may make their report at or after the hearing or they may, in their discretion, hold subsequent meetings. Sec. 6.108. Subsequent Meetings; When Notice Required. 1259 Subsequent meetings of the appraisers shall be held at such times and places as may be determined by them. Of such meetings no notice need be given either to the owners or to the city unless such meetings are to be public and for the purpose of hearing evidence. If held for such purpose, then unless such meeting is held at a time and place to which a former meeting of which the parties had lawful notice was adjourned, notice of the meeting shall be personally served upon all the parties, or, if such notice cannot be personally served, it may be served by publication once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper published in the city which is qualified to carry legal notices, or, if there be no such newspaper, by posting in three public places in the city. The notice shall be served or publication or posting thereof completed not less than five days prior to the time fixed for the meeting. Sec. 6.109. Determination of Damages and Benefits; Report. In determining the compensation to be paid by the city for the land or easement condemned, the appraisers shall take into consideration both the loss or damage which will result to the owners from the condemnation of the land or easement and the benefits that will result to, any remainder of such land from the improvement for which the land or easement is to be condemned, the benefits to include both benefits or advantages special to the land and the benefits or advantages to the land in common with other lands affected by the improvement. The appraisers shall also take into consideration the value of any building or other property situated on the land proposed to be condemned if the owner is to be allowed to remove the building or other property, and the value thereof shall not be included in the compensation award. Having determined damages and benefits, the appraisers shall make their report to the city council, in which report the appraisers shall show separately the amount of damages, the amount of benefits, and the amount which shall be paid by the city if it finally condemns the land or easement. In the event the property condemned is subject to a recorded lease or leases, the appraisers shall apportion the award between or among the person or persons owning the fee or fees and the person or persons owning the leasehold interest or interests; but in no event shall the total of the amounts so apportioned exceed the value of the property were it not subject to a recorded lease or leases. The report shall be sufficient if it is concurred in by two of three appraisers. In the event that no two of the three appraisers can agree upon an appraisal, three new appraisers may be appointed in the same manner as the original appraisers, and the new appraisal board shall follow the same procedure as required of the original appraisal board. Sec. 6.110. Action of Council on Report. Within thirty days after the report of the appraisers is submitted to the city council, the council shall determine what action it will take thereon. If the council determines to abandon the proposed condemnation, it shall adopt a resolution to that effect; but the abandonment of the condemnation shall not prevent the city council from thereafter instituting a proceeding to condemn the same land or easement. If the council determines to condemn the land or easement, it shall adopt a resolution which shall contain substantially the following: 1260 -1 A recital that a board of appraisers has been appointed to determine the compensation to be paid for the land or easement, as provided by this charter, and that the appraisers have submitted their report to the council; -2 A statement of the amount of damages and benefits as fixed by the appraisers and of the compensation to be paid by the city for the land or easement condemned as fixed by the appraisers; -3 The determination of the council as to the condemnation of the land or easement; -4 A description of the land condemned in fee or of the easement condemned; -5 A statement of the purpose for which the land or easement is condemned; -6 The name of the owner or owners of the land and of other persons interested therein who were made parties to the proceeding; -7 The determination of the council as to the time when the city will take possession of the land or easement condemned, and a direction that such premises shall be vacated by such time, and, in case the owner is allowed to remove any building or part thereof or any other property on the premises, a direction that such property shall be removed before said date and that if the owner fails to remove the same within said time, the council will have the same removed and the cost thereof shall be a lien upon the remainder of the property. Sec. 6.111. Vesting of Title in City. The adoption by the city council of a final resolution of condemnation, as provided in the preceding Section shall have the effect of a judgment against the City of Greensboro for the amount of compensation fixed by the appraisers and shall vest in the city title to the land or easement condemned. Sec. 6.112. Appeal to Superior Court. If upon the adoption by the city council of a final resolution of condemnation, either the owner of the land or easement condemned or the city council itself is dissatisfied with the amount of the compensation to be paid for such land or easement as fixed by the appraisers, such owner or the city or both may, within ten days from the date of adoption of such resolution, appeal to the Superior Court of Guilford County. The party or parties appealing shall, within said ten days, give notice of appeal to the other party by personal service if practicable and, if not, by publication of a notice one time in a newspaper published in the city which is qualified to carry legal notices. The appeal or appeals shall not interfere with the vesting in the city of the title to the land or easement condemned or hinder the city in any way from proceeding with the improvements for which such land or easement was condemned, except that if the land or interest therein is owned by another public or quasi-public body, or by a railroad or public utility company, the vesting of title in the city shall not become effective until the court has rendered final judgment on the question of whether the condemnation by the city is in the public interest, and has determined the amount of compensation to be awarded for the condemnation, in which case 1261 the court may, in its discretion, reduce the amount of land or interest therein which it shall allow to be condemned. Sec. 6.113. Record upon Appeal.  Upon an appeal taken by either party, the city clerk shall certify a copy of the record in the condemnation proceeding to the Superior Court of Guilford County, and such appeal shall be tried as other actions at law. The record upon appeal shall be composed of the preliminary resolution of condemnation, the oath of appraisers, the report of appraisers, the final resolution of condemnation, and the notice or notices of appeal. The record upon appeal, or any part thereof, shall be competent as evidence upon the trial of an appeal. Sec. 6.114. Condemnation before Determination of Compensation. When, in the judgment of the city council, the public interest requires that the city enter into immediate possession of any land, it shall adopt a resolution stating such necessity and the reason therefor, and condemning the required land or easement, and providing for the determination of the compensation to be paid by the city for the land or easement. The procedure therefor with respect to determination of such compensation shall follow as closely as practicable the provisions of this Article, or of the provisions of general law concerning Eminent Domain. This Section shall not apply to land, or interests therein, owned by another public or quasipublic body, or railroad or public utility company. Sec. 6.115. Registration of Condemnation Proceedings. In any case where any land or any easement therein has been or may hereafter be condemned by the city council, a copy of so much of the condemnation proceedings as may be necessary to show the land or easement therein condemned and the condemnation thereof shall be certified by the city clerk and the same, upon being probated by the Clerk of the Superior Court, or other person authorized by law to probate instruments for registration, shall be registered in the office of the Register of Deeds of Guilford County. Sec. 6.116. Sale or Other Disposition of Land Condemned. When any land condemned in fee by the city is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was condemned, the same may be used by the city for any other public purpose or may be sold or otherwise disposed of. See. 6.117. Removal by City of Structures on Condemned Land; Lien. When property upon which any building or other structure is wholly or partly located is condemned by the city under the provisions of this charter or any other law, and the owner is allowed to remove such building or structure or part thereof, the city council may, after the report of the appraisers has been made, name the time within which the owner may remove the building or structure, or part thereof, and if the owner fails to remove the same within said time, the council may remove the same and the cost thereof shall be a lien upon the remainder of said land, or such cost may be recovered by the city in any court of competent jurisdiction. Sec. 6.118. Procedure Not Exclusive. The condemnation procedure set forth in this Article shall not be exclusive, but shall be in addition to any other procedure provided by law. 1262 42 Sec. 6.119. Procedure Not Applicable Outside of Guilford County. The condemnation procedure set forth in Article 2 of Chapter 40 of the General Statutes of North Carolina and not the procedure set forth in this Article shall be applicable to the exercise of the power of eminent domain by the city for the condemnation of any land, right of access, right-of-way, water right, privilege, easement, or any other interest in or relating to land or water which is or are located outside of the geographic boundaries of Guilford County.

Whenever the council finds it in the public interest, and it will be more economical and the interest of the property owners will best be served by constructing either water or sanitary sewer mains, or both, between streets rather than in a street, the petition may provide therefor, or in the event the water and sanitary sewer mains may be constructed in a street without petition, they may be constructed between streets without petition. The cost 1264 of the construction of such water or sewer mains and laterals shall be assessed according to the street frontage in the same manner and to the same extent that it would be assessed if the improvements were constructed in a street; provided that the city shall provide the rights-of-way for construction and maintenance of such mains at its own expense without assessing the cost thereof. Sec. 6.136. Inclusion of More than Improvement in Single Proceeding. (a) Any proceeding may include one or more local improvements on one or more streets, but all improvements included in one procedure shall be practically uniform in cost and kind.

(b) The petition may provide for making any one or more local improvements in or on a street or streets and for the assessment of the cost thereof, except the citys portion, wholly against the property abutting one side of such street or streets or otherwise against such abutting property as may be designated in the petition in any of the following cases: -1 In any case where there is park land or unimproved land abutting one side, or a part of one side, of a street; or -2 where the land abutting one side, or a part of one side of a street, is of such a nature or is devoted to such a purpose that a special assessment against it cannot be made, or, if made would probably exceed the value of the land assessed; or -3 where the owners of all the property to be assessed agree thereto. Sec. 6.137. The Petition; Certificate of Sufficiency. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), the petition for any local improvements shall designate by a general description the improvements proposed, and shall request that such proportion of the cost of each of such improvements as may be specified in the petition be specially assessed against the property abutting on the street or streets or part thereof in which or on which such improvements are proposed to be made. The petition shall be filed with the city attorney. (b) -1 In any case where the improvement is to be made on one side of a street only, the petition shall request that the assessment be made only against the property abutting that side of the street whereon the improvement is to be made. -2 In any case where it is proposed to assess the cost of any local improvement covering the entire width of a street against the land abutting one side of the street only or against any lands less than all of those abutting the improved portion of the street, such petition shall designate the lands to be assessed.

(b) The notice shall be published one time in a newspaper published in the city which is qualified to carry legal notices, or, if there be no such newspaper, the city clerk shall cause it to be posted in three public places in the city, the date of publication or posting to be not less than ten days prior to the date fixed for the hearing. A copy of the notice shall be served upon the owners of the lands subject to assessment for such improvements if such owners can be found with reasonable diligence within the city. If any such owner cannot with reasonable diligence be found within the city, then a copy of the notice shall be mailed to his address, as nearly as the same can be ascertained with due diligence. The certificate of the person designated to serve or mail the notices that such notices were served or mailed shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud. The serving or mailing of notices shall be completed not less than five days prior to the date fixed for the hearing. The word owners as used herein has the same meaning as in Section 6.137. Sec. 6.140. Public Hearing. At the time for the public hearing, or at some subsequent time to which such hearing shall be adjourned, the council shall consider objections to the legality of the improvements made in compliance with paragraph -5 of subsection (a) of the preceding Section, together with objections to the policy or expediency of the making of the improvements, and the council shall thereafter determine whether it will order the making of the improvements. Any objections to the legality of the making of the improve- 1267 ments not made in writing, signed in person or by attorney, and filed with the city clerk at or before the time or adjourned time of the hearing shall be considered as waived; and if any such objection shall be made and shall not be sustained by the council, the adoption of the resolution ordering the making of the improvements shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented, unless within ten days after the adoption of the resolution proper steps shall be taken in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief. See. 6.141. Resolution Ordering Improvements; Publication. (a) After the public hearing, if the council determines to make the improvements proposed, it shall adopt a resolution which shall contain: -1 If the improvements are to be made by petition, a finding by the council as to the sufficiency of the petition, which finding shall be final and conclusive. -2 If the improvements are to be made without petition, a finding by the council of such facts as are required in order to authorize improvements without petition. -3 A general description of the improvements to be made and the designation of the street or streets or parts thereof where the work is to be done. -4 If the improvement directed to be made is the paving of a roadway or part thereof wherein a railroad company has tracks, a direction that said company pave that part of the street occupied by its tracks, the rails of the tracks, and 18 inches in width outside such tracks, with such material and in such manner as the governing body may prescribe, and that unless such paving be completed on or before a day specified in the resolution, the goverriing body will cause the same to be done. Where such railroad company shall occupy such street or streets under a franchise or contract which otherwise provides, such franchise or contract shall not be affected by this Section, except insofar as may be consistent with the provisions of such franchise or contract. -5 If the improvement directed to be made includes the construction of water mains or sewers, and in order to provide the mains or sewers in the street or streets to be improved it is necessary to extend them beyond the limits of the street or streets, the resolution shall contain a provision for the necessary extension of such mains or sewers and a further provision that the cost of such extension shall eventually be assessed against the lots or parcels of land abutting the street or streets in which such extensions are made but that assessments shall not be made until such time as the council shall thereafter determine by appropriate resolution. -6 If the improvement directed to be made is the paving of a roadway or part thereof, or the construction of sidewalks, the resolution may, but need not, contain a direction that the owner of each lot abutting the part of the street to be improved, connect his lot by means of laterals with water mains, gas or sewer pipes, or any one or more thereof, located in the street adjacent to his premises in accordance with the requirements governing the laying of laterals, and that unless the owners cause laterals to 1268 be laid on or before a date specified in the resolution, the date to be not less than thirty days after the date of the resolution, the council will cause the same to be laid. -7 A designation of the proportion of the cost of the improvements to be assessed against abutting property, and of the number of equal annual installments in which assessments may be paid. (b) The resolution after its passage shall be published at least once in some newspaper published in the city which is qualified to carry legal notices, or, if there be no such newpaper, the resolution shall be posted in three public places in the city for at least five days; except, that in any case where the council directed that the notice should be served or mailed instead of being published, the resolution ordering the improvements need not be either published or posted. Sec. 6.142. Details of Construction; Contracts for Construction. The council shall have power to determine the character and type of construction and of material to be used and to determine any other details of plan or construction necessary to be determined in making any local improvements and to determine whether any work to be done by the city shall be done by contract or by the city. The council shall have power also, unless otherwise limited, to determine the number of water, sewer and gas laterals that shall be laid to any lot on any street to be improved. If the work or any part thereof is to be done by contract, the council may let all of the work in one contract, or it may divide it into several contracts, and may let contracts separately. Sec. 6.1438. Determination as to Cost of Improvements. Upon completion of the improvements, the council shall ascertain the total cost. In addition to other items of cost, there may be included therein the cost of all necessary legal services, the amount of interest paid during construction, the amount of damages paid or to be paid for injury to property by reason of any change of grade or drainage, including court costs and other expenses incidental to the determination of damages, and the cost of retaining walls, sidewalks or fences built or altered in lieu of cash payment for property damage, including the cost of moving or altering any building. The determination of the council as to the total cost of any improvement shall be conclusive. Sec. 6.144. Preliminary Assessment. (a) Having determined the total cost, the council shall make a preliminary assessment. The preliminary assessment shall be advisory only and shall be subject to modification. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), the preliminary assessment shall be as follows: -1 Roadway paving. The total cost of any roadway paving improvement, excluding the cost incurred at street intersections, shall be specially assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting the street containing the roadway paved, according to the frontages thereon, by an equal rate per foot of frontage, except that, where the petition so requested, the cost shall be assessed against the lands on one side of the street only or against such lands as were designated in the petition. 1269 -2 Water mains and sewers. The cost of not exceeding an eight-inch water or sanitary sewer main and of not exceeding a thirty-inch storm sewer main shall be assessed against the abutting property. Such cost shall be assessed against the lots and parcels of land according to their respective frontages thereon by an equal rate per foot of such frontage. If a water or sanitary sewer main in excess of eight inches in size or a storm sewer in excess of thirty inches in size is laid, the excess cost shall be borne by the city. If the resolution ordered the construction of any pumping station, outfall, septic tank or disposal plant, no part of the cost of the same shall be specially assessed. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit the power of the council to contract with any property owner or owners for the construction of any pumping station, outfall, septic tank or disposal plant or for the construction of water mains or storm or sanitary sewers and for the assessment of the cost thereof according to the terms of such contract. The entire cost of each water and sewer lateral shall be specially charged against the particular lot or parcel of land for or in connection with which it was constructed, except that the assessments shall be calculated as if the lateral were laid from the center of the street. The cost of installing storm sewers may, however, be assessed as part of the cost of roadway paving. -8 Sidewalks. The total cost of constructing or reconstructing sidewalks shall be assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting that side of the street upon which the improvement is made according to their respective frontages thereon by an equal rate per foot of such frontage, the lots within a block being deemed to abut upon a sidewalk although the latter extends beyond the lot to the curb line of an intersecting street. The total cost of constructing portions of driveways within the street area shall be assessed against the lots for which they are constructed. -4 Grass plots. The entire cost of grading or otherwise improving or of planting the grass plots in any street or part thereof shall be assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting the street or part thereof where or whereon the improvements are made by an equal rate per front foot of such frontage; provided, that this subsection shall be construed to mean that when a grass plot in any street is graded or planted or otherwise improved, the cost thereof shall be assessed against all of the property abutting the street within the block where such grass plot is located. (b) If the petition (or the resolution in those cases where the improvement was ordered made without petition) specified that there should be specially assessed against the abutting property a smaller proportion of the cost of any improvement than that set forth in subsection (2), there shall be assessed against abutting property only the proportion of the cost as was specified in the petition or in said resolution. No restriction or denial of access to an abutting street shall affect the levy or collection of any assessment for local improvements. (c) The cost of paving, water, sewer, and sidewalk improvements upon, in, or to any portion of a right-of-way or any property owned by the State of North Carolina, any agency or subdivision thereof, shall be assessed against the right-of-way or property and shall be paid by the State, its agency or subdivision. 1270 Sec. 6.145. Corner Lot Exemptions. The council shall have authority to determine the amount and applicability of assessment exemptions for corner lots, and to distinguish between different classifications of property uses. The exemptions for paving sidewalk, and storm sewer improvements shall not exceed sixty feet and shall be limited to residential uses, and the exemptions for water mains and sanitary sewers shall not exceed one hundred and fifty feet for residential uses and one hundred feet for business uses. If the corner formed by two intersecting streets is rounded into a curve or is foreshortened for the purpose of providing sight distance or for any other purpose of construction, the frontage for assessment purposes shall be calculated to the midpoint of the curve or foreshortened corner. Sec. 6.146. Preliminary Assessment Roll. The council shall cause to be prepared a preliminary assessment roll, on which shall be entered a brief description of each lot or parcel of land assessed, the amount assessed against each lot, the name or names of the owner or owners of each lot, as far as the same can be ascertained; provided, that a map of the improvements on which is shown the frontage and location of each affected lot, together with the amount assessed against each lot and the name or names of the owner or owners thereof, as far as the same can be ascertained, shall be a sufficient assessment roll. If the resolution directed the making of more than one improvement, a single preliminary assessment roll for all the improvements authorized by such resolution shall be sufficient, but the cost of each improvement to each lot affected shall be shown separately. After the preliminary assessment roll has been completed, it shall be filed in the office of the city clerk, and there shall be published in some newspaper published in the city which is qualified to carry legal notices, or if there be no such newspaper, the city clerk shall cause to be posted in three public places in the city, a notice of the completion of the assessment roll, setting forth a description in general terms of the improvements, the amount of each assessment, and stating the time fixed for the meeting of the council for the hearing of objections to the special assessments, such meeting to be not earlier than ten days after the first publication or from the date of posting of said notice. Any number of assessment rolls may be included in one notice. In any case where the preliminary notice was served or mailed instead of being published, this notice need not be published or posted but may be served or mailed. The serving or mailing of notices shall be completed not less than five days prior to the date fixed for the hearing of the assessment roll, and the return of the person serving or mailing the same shall in the absence of fraud be conclusive that the same were served or mailed. Sec. 6.147. Hearing; Revision; Confirmation; Lien. At the time appointed for that purpose or at some other time to which it may adjourn, the council shall hear objections to the preliminary assessment roll of all persons interested who may appear and offer proof in relation thereto. Then or thereafter, the council shall either annul or sustain or modify in whole or in part the assessment, either by confirming the preliminary assessment against any or all lots or parcels described 1271 thereon, or by cancelling, increasing or reducing the same, according to the special benefits which the council decides each of the lots or parcels has received or will receive on account of the improvements, except that assessments against railroads because of contract or franchise obligations shall be in accordance with such obligations. If any property is omitted from the preliminary roll, the council may place it on the roll and levy the proper assessment. The council may thereupon confirm the assessment roll, and the assessments so confirmed shall be in proportion to the special benefits, except in the case of franchise obligations of railroads. Whenever the governing body shall confirm assessments for local improvements, the city clerk shall enter on the council minutes and on the assessment roll the date, hour, and minute of confirmation, and from the time of confirmation the assessments shall be a lien on the property assessed of the same nature and to the same extent as county and city taxes and shall be superior to all other liens and encumbrances. After the assessment roll is confirmed a copy of the same shall be delivered to the city tax collector. Sec. 6.148. Appeal to Superior Court. If the owner of, or any person interested in, any lot or parcel of land against which an assessment is made is dissatisfied with the amount of the assessment, he may, within ten days after the confirmation of the assessment roll, give written notice to the council that he takes an appeal to the Superior Court of Guilford County, in which case he shall within twenty days after the confirmation of the assessment roll serve on the mayor or city clerk a statement of facts upon which he bases his appeal. The appeal shall be tried as other actions at law. The remedy herein provided for any person dissatisfied with the amount of the assessment against any property of which he is the owner or in which he is interested shall be exclusive. Sec. 6.149. Power to Correct Error in Assessment. If it shall appear after confirmation of any assessment roll that an error has been made, the city clerk shall cause to be published one time in some newspaper published in the city, or if there be no such newspaper, the city clerk shall cause to be posted at three public places in the city, a notice referring to the assessment roll in which the error was made, naming the owner or owners of the lot or parcel of land affected by the error, if the same can be ascertained, and naming the time and place fixed for a hearing by the council for the correction of the error, such meeting not to be earlier than ten days from the publication or from the date of the posting of the notice. At the time fixed in the notice or at some subsequent time to which the council may adjourn, the council, after giving the owner or owners of the property affected and other persons interested therein an opportunity to be heard, may proceed to correct the error, and the assessment then made shall have the same force and effect as if it had originally been properly made. No notice and hearing shall be necessary if the correction does not increase an assessment against any property not owned by the city, or if all of the property owners affected by the correction waive notice in writing. 1272 Sec. 6.150. Reassessment. The council shall have the power, when in its judgment there is any irregularity, omission, error or lack of jurisdiction in any of the proceedings relating thereto, to set aside the whole of the local assessment made by it, and thereupon to make a reassessment. In such case there shall be included, as a part of the cost of the improvements involved, all interest paid or accrued on notes or certificates of indebtedness, or bonds issued by the city to pay the expenses of such improvement. The proceeding shall, as far as practicable, be in all respects as in the case of original assessments, and the reassessment shall have the same force as if it had originally been properly made. Sec. 6.151. Publication of Notice of Confirmation of Assessment Roll. After the expiration of twenty days from the confirmation of the assessment roll, the city clerk shall cause to be published one time in some newspaper published in the city which is qualified to carry legal notices, or, if there be no such newspaper, shall cause to be posted at three public places in the city, a notice of confirmation of the assessment roll, and that assessments may be paid at any time before the expiration of thirty days from the date of publication or posting of the notice, without interest from the date of confirmation of the assessment roll, but that if such assessment is not paid in full within said time, all installments thereof shall bear interest at the rate of six per centum per annum from the date of confirmation of the assessment roll. Sec. 6.152. Payment of Assessments in Cash or by Installments. The property owner or railroad company assessed shall have the option of paying for improvements in cash or in not less than two or more than ten equal annual installments as may have been determined in the resolution ordering the improvements. If paid in installments, installments shall bear interest at the rate of six per centum per annum from the date of confirmation of the assessment roll. If any assessment is not paid in cash, the first installment with interest shall become due and payable thirty days after the publication or posting of the notice of confirmation, and one subsequent installment and interest shall be due and payable on the same day of the same month in each successive year until the assessment is paid in full; provided, however, that if the council shall so direct installments shall become due and payable on the same date when property taxes of the city are due and payable. If any installment with interest is not paid when due, it shall be subject to the same penalties as are now prescribed by law for unpaid taxes, in addition to the interest herein provided for. The whole assessment may be paid at any time by the payment of the full amount due with accrued interest. Sec. 6.153. Enforcement of Payment of Assessments. Upon the failure of any property owner to pay any installment when due and payable, all of the installments remaining unpaid shall immediately become due and payable, and property and rights-of-way may be sold by the city under the same rules, regulations, rights of redemption and savings as are now prescribed by law for the sale of land for unpaid taxes. Unpaid assessments, interest, and penalties owed by railroad companies 1273 and the State of North Carolina, its agencies or subdivisions, may be collected by writs of mandamus issued by the Superior Court of Guilford County. Collection of assessments with interest and penalties may also be made by the city by proceedings to foreclose the lien of assessments as a lien for mortgages is or may be foreclosed under the laws of the State, and it shall be lawful to join in any bill for foreclosure any one or more lots or parcels of land, by whomsoever owned, if assessed for an improvement ordered by the same resolution, after default in the payment of any installment. The payment of said installment, together with interest and penalties due thereon, before the lot or parcel of land, against which the same is a lien, is sold or said lien is foreclosed shall bar the right of the city to sell land or to foreclose the lien by reason of default. Sec. 6.154. Assessment of Cost of Water Main and Sewer Extensions. If the resolution ordering the making of any improvement or improvements included a provision for any necessary extension of a water main or sewer or sewers beyond the limit of a street or streets, at such time after the completion of said extension or extensions as, in the judgment of the council, circumstances justify the assessment of the cost thereof, the council shall cause a preliminary assessment to be made and the procedure thereafter to be followed with respect to such assessment and the force and effect thereof shall be as already prescribed for other assessments. Sec. 6.155. Apportionment of Assessments. In any case where one or more special assessments have been made, and property has been, or is about to be, subdivided, and it is desirable that the assessments be apportioned among the subdivisions of such property, the council may, upon application by the owner or owners, apportion the assessments among the subdivisions. Thereafter, each subdivision shall be relieved of any part of the original assessment except the part apportioned to the subdivision, and the part of the original assessment apportioned to any subdivision shall be of the same force and effect as the original assessment. Sec. 6.156. Change of Ownership. No change of ownership of any property or interest therein after the passage of a resolution ordering the making of a local improvement shall affect subsequent proceedings, and the improvement may be completed and assessments made therefor as if there had been no change in ownership. Sec. 6.157. Lands Subject to Assessment. No lands in the city, including railroad company lands and rights-ofway and property of the State of North Carolina, its agencies or subdivisions, shall be exempt from special assessments except lands belonging to the United States which are exempt under the provisions of Federal Statutes, and the council and the officers, trustees or boards of all incorporated or unincorporated bodies in whom is vested the right to hold and dispose of real property shall have the right by authority duly given to sign the petition for any local improvements. 1274 Sec. 6.158. Proceedings in Rem. All proceedings for special assessments shall be proceedings in rem, and no mistake or omission as to the name of any owner or person interested in any lot or parcel of land affected thereby shall be regarded as a substantial mistake or omission. Sec. 6.159. Grass Plot and Driveway Maintenance. It shall be the responsibility of the abutting property owner to maintain any grass plot or driveway between the property line and the curb of a paved street. Sec. 6.160. Council May Hold in Abeyance Certain Water and Sewer Assessments. (a) The city council may provide by resolution that assessments levied against abutting lots or parcels of land for water main improvements or sanitary sewer improvements, when in its opinion such improvements may not presently be used by the owner or owners of the abutting lots or parcels of land, may be held in abeyance without the payment of any interest thereon until such time as the council shall determine that any such assessments shall be paid in accordance with the terms set out in the confirming resolution. A part of the assessments, levied for the improvements herein set out on a street or streets, or portion thereof, may be held in abeyance as herein provided without holding all of said assessments in abeyance. (b) All statutes of limitations, and particularly the statute of limitations provided for in Chapter 331, Section 1, of Public Laws 1929 (G. S. 160-93) are hereby suspended during the time that any assessment is held in abeyance without the payment of interest, as provided in subsection (a). Such time shall not be a part of the time limited for the commencement of action for the enforcement of the payment of any such assessment, and such action may be brought at any time within ten years from the date of the adpotion of a resolution by the council, determining that such assessment shall be paid in accordance with the original resolution confirming it. (c) Nothing herein shall be construed to revive any right of action which has heretofore been barred by the statute of limitations. See. 6.161. Abutting Property Outside City Limits. If any lots or parcels of land abutting any local improvements are located outside the city limits, the council may continue and delay the levy of assessments against such property until the city limits are extended to include such property, or the council may provide that no water or sewer service connections shall be made to such property, pending the annexation thereof, until all assessments thereon are paid. Upon annexation, if not paid prior thereto, the council may levy assessments for such local improvements against such property, and the procedure therefor shall be the same as provided in this charter. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to prohibit or restrict the city council and a property owner from entering into an agreement for payments in lieu of assessments. 1275 CHAPTER VII. MISCELLANEOUS SUBCHAPTER A. CLAIMS AGAINST THE CITY. Sec. 7.01. Presentation of Claims to City Council. No action shall be instituted or maintained against the City of Greensboro upon any claim or demand whatever of any kind or character until the claimant shall have first presented in writing his or her claim or demand to the city council and the council shall have declined to pay or settle the same as presented, or for sixty days after presentation shall have neglected to enter or cause to be entered upon its minutes its determination in regard thereto. Nothing contained in this subchapter shall be construed to prevent any statute of limitations from commencing to run at the time when a claim accrued or demand arose, or in any manner to interfere with its running. Sec. 7.02. Time for Presentation of Claims. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section, no action for damages of any character whatever, to either person or property, shall be instituted against the city unless, within six months after the happening or infliction of the injury complained of, the complainant, his executor, administrator, guardian, or next friend shall have given notice in writing to the council of the injury, stating in the notice the date and place of the injury, the manner of infliction, the character of the injury, and the amount of damage claimed. (b) No action shall be instituted against the city on account of damages to or compensation for real property used or taken by the city for any public purpose of any kind unless, within two years after such alleged use, the owner, his executor, administrator, guardian, or next friend shall have given notice in writing to the council of the claim, the notice to set forth the date that the alleged use commenced, a description of the property alleged to have been used, and the amount of damage or compensation claimed. (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) and (b), if a complainant suffers from physical or mental incapacity that renders it impossible for him to give notice, his action shall not be barred if notice of claim is given by him or on his behalf within six months after the termination of the physical or mental incapacity, provided that minority shall not of itself constitute physical or mental incapacity. If the complainant is a minor, his action shall not be barred if notice of claim is given on his behalf within three years after the happening or the infliction of the injury complamed of; or, if the minor suffers from physical or mental incapacity that renders it impossible for him to give notice, his action shall not be barred if notice of claim is given on his behalf within six months after termination of the physical or mental incapacity, or within three years after the happening or infliction of the injury complained of, whichever is the longer period. The city at any time may request the appointment of a next friend to represent any person having a potential claim against the city and known to be suffering from physical or mental incapacity. 1276 Sec. 7.03. Settlement of Claims by City Manager. The city manager may settle claims against the city for -1 personal injury or for damages to property when the amount involved does not exceed the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) and does not exceed the actual loss sustained, including loss of time, medical expenses, and any other expense actually incurred, and -2 the taking of small portions of private property which are needed for the rounding of corners at street intersections, when the amount involved in any such settlement does not exceed the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) and does not exceed the actual loss sustained. Settlement of a claim by the city manager pursuant to this Section shall constitute a complete release of the city from any and all damages sustained by the person involved in such settlement in any manner arising out of the accident, occasion, or taking complained of. All such releases shall be subject to the approval of the city attorney."

In the event that a ballot shall become torn, or be incorrectly marked by a voter or otherwise be mutilated or defaced, and a voter shall discover same before depositing the ballot in the ballot box, he may return the ballot to a judge or registrar and obtain another, but in no event shall he obtain more than three extra ballots of any one kind.

Any person making such challenge at the polls may enter the voting enclosure to give the reasons for the challenge, but must leave as soon as he has done so. If the election officials shall decide that the challenged voter is qualified te vote, he shall be permitted to vote in the usual manner, except that he must sign his ballots so that they may be identified in the event of an appeal from the decision of the precinct officials to the City Council or to the courts as herein provided. 149 (d) VOTING ENCLOSURE: No one shall be allowed inside the voting enclosure while the polls are open except election officials, their qualified assistants, voters in the act of voting, persons assisting voters who are entitled to be assisted, peace officers actually engaged in keeping the peace and challengers while giving reasons for a challenge, and it shall be the duty of the election officials to maintain peace and good order, prevent and stop any improper practice or any attempt to obstruct, intimidate or interfere with any voter in the exercise of his right to vote.

Any person so committed shall be allowed to post bond in the sum of two hundred dollars ($200.00) with the Clerk of the Superior Court of Robeson County, at which time, his appeal to the Court for a trial on the merits of the commitment shall be heard.

(f) ABSENTEE VOTING: There shall be no absentee voting in municipal primaries or elections conducted in the City of Lumberton. Section 8 COUNTING AND RECORDING VOTES: (a) COUNTING PROCEDURES: Immediately following the announcement of the registray that the polls are closed, and after all persons who are within the voting enclosure at the time of such announcement have voted, the registrar, together with the judges of elections shall open the ballot boxes and proceed to count the ballots. The counting of the ballots shall be made in the presence of the election officials and such persons as may be present and desire to observe the count, provided, however, that the election officials shall arrange for the ballots to be counted in such way that no observer can interfere with the counting, but so that any such observers, from a reasonable distance, can observe the number of ballots being counted and the manner in which they are marked. All such observers shall be permitted to be present during the count as may, in the opinion of the election officials, and within the limitations of available space, be reasonable and proper and in accord with good order. The registrar and the judges of election shall remain together in the voting place from the time the ballot boxes are opened for counting until all votes are counted and returns made out as hereinafter provided. If, for any reason, during the counting, the registrar shall be compelled to leave the voting place, or for any other reason cannot serve, the judges of election shall appoint a person in his 150 place; likewise, if one of the judges of election is compelled to leave or for any reason cannot serve, the registrar shall appoint a replacement for the absent judge of election. In the event that precinct ballot counters have been named by either the City Council or the precinct registrar as herein provided, such ballot counters, upon accepting their appointments, shall appear immediately upon the closing of the polls, and the precinct registrar shall administer to them an oath that they will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of North Carolina not inconsistent therewith and that they will fairly and honestly tabulate the votes cast in the election concerned. The registrar shall instruct the ballot counters and judges regarding the manner in which ballots must be marked and how they must be counted, and thereafter, the counting shall commence. In the event that ballot counters are used, the precinct registrar and judges of elections shall maintain supervision over the counting of all ballots and remain responsible therefor. As the counting proceeds, any question concerning the method of counting, or the tabulation of any vote, shall be referred to the registrar and judges of election for determination before the completion of the counting of the ballots in the box from which the questioned ballot or ballots were taken. More than one ballot box may be counted at the same time, but the name of each candidate voted for shall be read aloud and the vote received by such candidate shall be entered on a tally sheet. Pieces of plain paper on which voters have written the names of individuals for whom they desire to vote for a given office are not proper ballots and shall not be counted; no ballot which is folded with any paper or other article in it, or which contains the names of more persons than those for which the voter has the right to vote, or which has any device or ornament on it, or which does not reveal the voters choice, shall be counted. No ballot cast in the election for the City Council shall be counted if the voter has failed to vote for a number of candidates at least equal to the number of vacancies on the City Council to be filled by the election, and ballots for any lesser number shall be treated as spoiled.

If the bid is rejected, the Council may readvertise the property for sale. Section 5 SALE OR EXCHANGE OF EXCESS PROPERTY: In any case where the City has purchased property instead of taking it by condemnation for any public purpose, and, in the opinion of the Council, it is desirable to sell any excess of the property, that is, such property as is not needed for the particular improvement of public purpose, the Council may sell it by public sale, by receiving sealed bids, or by exchanging it for other property. In such case the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 shall not apply, except that public sale shall be as provided by Section 4 Section 6 LEASE OF PROPERTY: (a) Any property owned by the City, whether originally acquired for governmental or other purposes, may be rented or leased by the Council for a term not to exceed ten years if, in the opinion of the City Council, the property will not be needed by the City for the period of the lease.

Nothing herein contained, however, shall be construed to mean that the powers herein granted shall extend to permit the violation of any trust, or covenant or condition contained in any deed of property to the City for special purposes, or upon a specific trust or upon a specific condition of use for a special purpose. (b) The City Council may -1 sell, as provided in Section 4 of this Article, any part of any real property heretofore or hereafter conveyed or dedicated to the City for parks, recreation or playgrounds; and -2 dedicate and use for street, sidewalk, water, or sewer purposes such portion or portions of any such property as in the opinion of the City Council public convenience or necessity may require; but nothing herein shall have the effect of altering the terms or conditions of any agreement with the City, or conveyance to the City, relative to the use of property.

In the event that a draft or check is presented to the City which constitutes a release, instead of a regular release form, the Manager may direct that such draft or check be handled as other payments to the City and, when approved by the Manager, it shall constitute a release to the extent stated on the draft or check. (b) The City may quitclaim any rights it may have in property not needed for public purposes upon report by the City Attorney and City Manager, and adoption of a resolution by the City Council, both finding that the property is not needed for public purposes and that the Citys interest has no readily ascertainable monetary value.

If any street under the provision of such ordinance is to be widened, it need not be widened on both sides; and, if it is to be widened on both sides, the distance to be widened on both sides need not be the same. Any ordinance introduced for the purpose of widening, extending, or opening any street under the provisions of this Charter, may not be adopted until the proposed ordinance is published in a newspaper published in the City and qualified to carry legal notices at least two times, on separate days, at least ten days before the passage of the ordinance, or if there be no such newspaper, posted in three public places in the City. There shall be posted or published with the ordinance a notice stating when property owners may be heard by the Council. A public hearing on the question of the adoption of such ordinance shall be held prior to the passage of the ordinance. (b) Notice to City Required before Improvement: After the passage of such ordinance, it shall be unlawful for any land within the proposed street lines established by such ordinance to be built upon or improved, or for any part of any existing building within said lines to be repaired or otherwise improved until the City shall have first been given an opportunity to purchase or otherwise acquire said property for street purposes as provided in this Charter. To that end, any person proposing to build upon such land or to make repairs or improvements to that part of any existing building situated thereon shall, in writing, notify the City Council of the nature and estimated cost of such building, repairs, or improvements. The Council shall then determine whether it will take the necessary steps to acquire said land prior to the construction of said building or the making of such repairs or improvements, and if it fails within sixty days from date of receipt of said notice to acquire, or to institute condemnation proceedings to acquire, said property, the owner or other person giving such notice may proceed to erect the building in accordance with the ordinances and regulations of the City, or to make the repairs or improvements described in said notice. (c) Failure to Give Notice Bars Recovery: If any person, firm, or corporation builds upon any land included with proposed street lines, or repairs or otherwise improves that part of any existing building with proposed street lines without giving the City an opportunity to acquire said land free from said improvements, as provided in the preceding subsection of this Article, the City shall not be required to pay for the value of the building, repairs, or improvements in any proceeding subsequently brought to acquire said land for the purpose set out in said subsection. (d) Acquisition of Land: If upon receiving any notice in compliance with subsection (b) of this Article, the City Council determines to acquire said land immediately, it may acquire the same by grant, purchase, or condemnation. In no case shall an effort to purchase said land be necessary to the institution of condemnation proceedings. If the Council determines to proceed by condemnation, the condemnation shall be as set forth in this Charter. (e) Cost of Land Acquired for Street Widening to be Assessed as Part of Improvement: After any land has been purchased or condemned for 179 the purpose of widening, extending, or opening any street, and the land purchased or condemned lies within the limits of an improvement directed in said proceeding, then the amount paid by the City for the land purchased or condemned, together with the cost of the condemnation proceeding and interest on said amount paid and costs at the rate of six per cent per annum from the date of payment, shall be included in the cost of said improvement and shall be assessed as provided by law against the property to be assessed for the improvements. (f) Exercise of Condemnation Power after Failure to Condemn Following Notice: The failure of the City to acquire any land within thirty days after receiving notice that the same is to be built upon, or that a building thereon is to be repaired or otherwise improved, or its failure within said time to institute proceedings to condemn the same, shall not limit the right of the City at any subsequent time to condemn the same; but in such case the owner shall be entitled to compensation as provided by law for the building, repairs, or improvements made after the giving of the required notice and the failure of the City to acquire said land free of said improvements. (g) Power to Close Streets: The City Council shall have the power to close any street or portion thereof that is now or may hereafter be opened or dedicated, either by the recording of a subdivision plat or otherwise. Upon receipt of a sufficient petition signed by the owners of a majority of the property abutting a street, requesting that it be closed, and after an investigation of the sufficiency of the petition by the City Attorney, the City Clerk shall publish a notice of a public hearing to be held by the Council, such publication to be once a week for four successive weeks, in some newspaper published in the City which is qualified to carry legal notices, or if there be no such newspaper, by posting a notice at three public places in the City. Any individual owning property abutting a street who do not join in the request for closing the street shall be notified by registered letter of the time and place of the public hearing. If it appears to the satisfaction of the City Council that the closing of the street is not contrary to the public interest, and that no individual owning property in the vicinity of the street or in the subdivision in which it is located will thereby be deprived of reasonable means of ingress or egress to his property, the City Council may order the closing of the street; provided, that any person aggrieved may appeal within thirty days from the order of the Council to the Superior Court of Robeson County, where the question shall be heard de novo. Upon such an appeal, the Superior Court shall have full jurisdiction to decide the matter upon the issues arising and to order the street closed upon proper finding of fact by a jury. A certified copy of the order of the Council (or the judgment of the Superior Court in the event of an appeal) shall be filed in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Robeson County. Upon the closing of a street in accordance with the provisions of this subsection of this Article, all right, title, and interest in the portion of the street closed shall be conclusively presumed to be vested in the owners of the lots or parcels of land abutting the portion of the street closed, and the title of each of such owners shall, for 180 the width of the abutting land owned by such persons, extend to the center of the street. Copies of the registered letters giving the notice required by this subsection of this Article, and the return receipts or other good and sufficient evidence of the giving of the required notice, shall be recorded in the register of deeds office, together with the resolution of the Council (or with the judgment of the Superior Court, in cases where an appeal was taken). No final action shall be taken by the City Council to close a street until the matter has been referred to the Lumberton Planning Board for study and recommendations, but no public hearing shall be necessary before the Lumberton Planning Board. (h) The resolution ordering the closing of a street may provide for utility rights-of-way to be retained by the City or public utility company, if needed. Section 7 WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND WASTE DISPOSAL AND OTHER UTILITIES: (a) Operation of Water Systems, Sewerage and Waste Disposal Systems, and other Utilities. The City Council may: 1 Provide for the construction or acquisition and operation of utilities and utility systems; 2 Acquire any real or personal property necessary or incidental thereto, including equipment, machinery, and all manner of rights or interests in or relating to land and water, and appurtenances thereto; and 3 Establish rates of charge for utility services and for the use of utility facilities. (b) The City Manager shall have the entire supervision and control of the management of all city utilities and utility systems. With the approval of the City Council he may adopt rules and regulations: 1 Concerning the management of utility and utility systems, with regard to such matters as maintenance, operation, and improvement thereof, or requiring the pretreatment of waste; and 2 Concerning collection of charges for utility services and for the use of utility facilities. If pursuant to any rule or regulation utility service to any property is discontinued, it shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation without the City Managers approval to renew a utility service or to use it without having first paid any outstanding charges and obtained the approval of the City Manager. Violations of this paragraph shall be misdemeanors punishable by a fine of not exceeding fifty dollars ($50.00), or imprisonment for not exceeding thirty days. As used in this Charter, unless the context otherwise requires, the term utility includes water supply, water distribution, sewerage, waste disposal, electric power, gas, and public transportation utilities. (c) Water Connection by Abutting Owners: The City Council may require that within thirty days after a water main or sewer main is completed and made ready for use, the owner of every abutting lot whereon water is supplied for any human use shall cause the lot to be connected to the water main or sewer main. 181 (d) Liens for Utility Charges: In case any charge for utility service or for the use of utility facilities is not paid within ten days after it becomes due, the same shall become a lien upon the property served or in connection with which the service or facility is used. The charge may at any time thereafter be collected, either by suit in the name of the City or by the City Tax Collector for the City, by the sale of the property upon which the lien attaches at the Robeson County Courthouse door, after advertising the sale once a week for four successive weeks in some newspaper published in the City which is qualified to carry legal notices. The sale shall be made under the same rules and regulations, and subject to the same costs and penalties and to the same rights of redemption as are provided by law for the foreclosure of the lien on real estate for taxes. ARTICLE XII. EMINENT DOMAIN Section 1 CONDEMNATION PROCEDURE; INTEREST ACQUIRED: The City of Lumberton shall possess the power of eminent domain, and may acquire, either by purchase or condemnation, any land, right of access, right-of-way, water right, privilege, easement, or any other interest in or relating to land or water, either within or beyond the city limits, including but not limited to a right-of-way in and across lands owned or held as right-of-way by a railroad or other public utility company (provided that the operation of such railroad or other public utility company may not be impaired unreasonably thereby), for any lawful public use or purpose. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the condemnation resolution, a fee simple title shall pass to the City upon the condemnation of any such interest.

Water rights or other interests relating to water may be condemned under the procedure set forth in this Article for the condemnation of land and interests therein. Section 2 EFFORT TO PURCHASE NOT REQUIRED: It shall not be necessary to the condemnation by the City of any land or interest therein, whether pursuant to this Article or otherwise that the City shall have attempted to acquire the needed land by grant or purchase prior to the commencement of condemnation proceedings.

Section 4 SERVICE OF RESOLUTION PROPOSING CONDEMNATION: A copy of the resolution proposing condemnation shall be personally served upon each of the owners of the land proposed to be condemned; provided, that if the resolution cannot be personally served upon any of the owners, then it may be served by publication once a week for two successive weeks in some newspaper published in the City which is qualified to carry legal notices, or, if there be no such newspaper, by posting in three public places in the City. Section 5 FAILURE OF OWNERS TO APPOINT APPRAISER: If within fifteen days after service of the resolution upon all of the owners, they or a majority in interest of them fail to appoint an appraiser and to report his name to the City Clerk, the City Council shall appoint a disinterested freeholder of the City to represent them. Section 6 APPOINTMENT OF THIRD APPRAISER; OATH: The appraiser appointed by the City Council, and the appraiser appointed by the owner or owners, or if the owner or owners fail to appoint, then the two appraisers appointed by the City Council, shall appoint a third appraiser, who shall be a disinterested freeholder of the City, and shall 183 report his name to the City Clerk. Each appraiser shall take an oath or affirmation that he will fairly and impartially discharge his duties as an appraiser. Section 7 FIRST MEETING OF APPRAISERS: At the time fixed by the resolution of condemnation, the appraisers shall meet on the premises proposed to be condemned. If for any reason a meeting cannot be held at the time fixed by the City Council, then a meeting shall be held at another time fixed by the appraisers, in which case notice of the time and place of the meeting shall be personally served upon each of the owners of the land or easement proposed to be condemned, or if the notice cannot be personally served, it may be served by publication once a week for two successive weeks in some newspaper published in the City which is qualified to carry legal notices, or, if there be no such newspaper, by posting in three public places in the City.

The notice shall be served or publication or posting thereof completed not less than five days prior to the time fixed for the meeting. Section 9 DETERMINATION OF DAMAGES AND BENEFITS; REPORT: In determining the compensation to be paid by the City for the land or easement condemned, the appraisers shall take into consideration both the loss or damage which will result to the owners from the condemnation of the land or easement and the benefits that will result to any remainder of such land from the improvement for which the land or easement is to be condemned, the benefits to include both benefits or advantages special to the land and the benefits or advantages to the land in common with other lands affected by the improvement. The appraisers shall also take into consideration the value of any building or other property situated on the land proposed to be condemned if the owner is to be allowed to remove the building or other property, and the value thereof shall not be included in the compensation award. Having determined damages and 184 benefits, the appraisers shall make their report to the City Council, in which report the appraisers shall show separately the amount of damages, the amount of benefits, and the amount which shall be paid by the City if it finally condemns the land or easement. In the event the property condemned is subject to a recorded lease or leases, the appraisers shall apportion the award between or among the person or persons owning the fee or fees and the person or persons owning the leasehold interest or interests; but in no event shall the total of the amounts so apportioned exceed the value of the property were it not subject to a recorded lease or leases. The report shall be sufficient if it is concurred in by two or three appraisers. In the event that no two of the three appraisers can agree upon an appraisal, three new appraisers may be appointed in the same manner as the original appraisers, and the new appraisal board shall follow the same procedure as required of the original appraisal board. Section 10 ACTION OF COUNCIL ON REPORT: Within thirty days after the report of the appraisers is submitted to the City Council, the Council shall determine what action it will take thereon. If the Council determines to abandon the proposed condemnation, it shall adopt a resolution to that effect; but the abandonment of the condemnation shall not prevent the City Council from thereafter instituting a proceeding to condemn the same land or easement. If the Council determines to condemn the land or easement, it shall adopt a resolution which shall contain substantially the following: (a) A recital that a board of appraisers has been appointed to determine the compensation to be paid for the land or easement, as provided by this Charter, and that the appraisers have remitted their report to the Council; (b) A statement of the amount of damages and benefits as fixed by the appraisers and of the compensation to be paid by the City for the land or easement condemned as fixed by the appraisers; (c) The determination of the Council as to the condemnation of the land or easement; (d) A description of the land condemned in fee or of the easement condemned; (e) A statement of the purpose for which the land or easement is condemned; (f) The name of the owner or owners of the land and of other persons interested therein who were made parties to the proceeding; (g) The determination of the Council as to the time when the City will take possession of the land or easement condemned, and a direction that such premises shall be vacated by such time, and, in case the owner is allowed to remove any building or part thereof or any other property on the premises, a direction that such property shall be removed before said date and that if the owner fails to remove the same within said time, the Council will have the same removed and the cost thereof shall be a lien upon the remainder of the property. Section 11 VESTING OF TITLE IN CITY: The adoption by the City Council of a final resolution of condemnation, as provided in the preceding 185 Section shall have the effect of a judgment against the City of Lumberton for the amount of compensation fixed by the appraisers and shall vest in the City title to the land or easement condemned. Section 12 APPEAL TO SUPERIOR COURT: If upon the adoption by the City Council of a final resolution of condemnation, either the owner of the land or easement condemned or the City Council itself is dissatisfied with the amount of the compensation to be paid for such land or easement as fixed by the appraisers, such owner or the City or both may, within ten days from the date of adoption of such resolution, appeal to the Superior Court of Robeson County. The party or parties appealing shall, within said ten days, give notice of appeal to the other party by personal service if practicable and, if not, by publication of a notice one time in a newspaper published in the City which is qualified to carry legal notices. The appeal or appeals shall not interfere with the vesting in the City of the title to the land or easement condemned or hinder the City in any way from proceeding with the improvements for which such land or easement was condemned, except that if the land or interest therein is owned by another public or quasi-public body, or by a railroad or public utility company, the vesting of title in the City shall not become effective until the Court has rendered final judgment on the question of whether the condemnation by the City is in the public interest, and has determined the amount of compensation to be awarded for the condemnation, in which case the Court may, in its discretion, reduce the amount of land or interest therein which it shall allow to be condemned. Section 13 RECORD UPON APPEAL: Upon an appeal taken by either party, the City Clerk shall certify a copy of the record in the condemnation proceeding to the Superior Court of Robeson County, and such appeal shall be tried as other actions at law. The record upon appeal shall be composed of the preliminary resolution of condemnation, the oath of appraisers, the report of appraisers, the final resolution of condemnation, and the notice or notices of appeal. The record upon appeal, or any part thereof, shall be competent as evidence upon the trial of an appeal. Section 14 CONDEMNATION BEFORE DETERMINATION OF COMPENSATION: When, in the judgment of the City Council, the public interest requires that the City enter into immediate possession of any land, it shall adopt a resolution stating such necessity and the reason therefor, and condemning the required land or easement, and providing for the determination of the compensation to be paid by the City for the land or easement. The procedure therefor with respect to determination of such compensation shall follow as closely as practicable the provisions of this Article, or the provisions of general law concerning Eminent Domain. This Section shall not apply to land, or interests therein, owned by another public or quasi-public body, or railroad or public utility company. Section 15 REGISTRATION OF CONDEMNATION PROCEEDINGS: In any case where any land or any easement therein has been or may hereafter be condemned by the City Council, a copy of so much of the condemnation proceedings as may be necessary to show the land or easement therein condemned and the condemnation thereof shall be certified by the 186 City Clerk and the same, upon being probated by the Clerk of the Superior Court, or other person authorized by law to probate instruments for registration, shall be registered in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Robeson County. Section 16 SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF LAND CONDEMNED: When any land condemned in fee by the City is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was condemned, the same may be used by the City for any other purpose or may be sold or otherwise disposed of. Section 17 REMOVAL BY CITY OF STRUCTURES ON CONDEMNED LAND; LIEN: When property upon which any building or other structure is wholly or partly located is condemned by the City under the provisions of this Charter or any other law, and the owner is allowed to remove such building or structure or part thereof, the City Council may, after the report of the appraisers has been made, name the time within which the owner may remove the building or structure, or part thereof, and if the owner fails to remove the same within said time, the Council may remove the same and the cost thereof shall be a lien upon the remainder of said land, or such cost may be recovered by the City in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(f) Upon the filing of such petition, the City Attorney shall investigate the sufficiency of the petition, and if it. is found to be sufficient, he shall certify the same to the Council.

A copy of the notice shall be served upon the owners of the lands subject to assessment for such improvements if such owners can be found with reasonable diligence within the City. If any such owner cannot with reasonable diligence be found within the City, then a .copy of the notice shall be mailed to his address, as nearly as the same can be ascertained with due diligence. The certificate of the person designated to serve or mail the notices that such notices were served or mailed shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud. The serving or mailing of notices shall be completed not less than five days prior to the date fixed for the hearing. The word owners as used herein has the same meaning as in Section 7 of this Article. Section 10 PUBLIC HEARING: At the time for the public hearing, or at some subsequent time to which such hearing shall be adjourned, the Council shall consider objections to the legality of the improvements made in compliance with paragraph -5 of subsection (a) of the preceding Section, together with objections to the policy or expediency of the making of the improvements, and the Council shall thereafter determine whether it will order the making of the improvements. Any objections to the legality of the making of the improvements not made in writing, signed in person or by attorney, and filed with the City Clerk at or before the time or adjourned time of the hearing shall be considered as waived; and if any such objection shall be made and shall not be sustained by the Council, the adoption of the resolution ordering the making of the improvements shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented, unless within ten days after the adoption of the resolution proper steps shall be taken in court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief. Section 11 RESOLUTION ORDERING IMPROVEMENTS: PUBLICATION: (a) After the public hearing, if the Council determines to make the improvements proposed, it shall adopt a resolution which shall contain: -1 If the improvements are to be made by petition, a finding by the Council as to the sufficiency of the petition, which finding shall be final and conclusive. -2 If the improvements are to be made without petition, a finding by the Council of such facts as are required in order to authorize improvements without petition. -3 A general description of the improvements to be made and the designation of the street or streets or parts thereof where the work is to be done. -4 If the improvement directed to be made is the paving of a roadway or part thereof wherein a railroad company has tracks, a direction that said company pave that part of the street occupied by its tracks, the rails 192 of the tracks, and 18 inches in width outside such tracks, with such material and in such manner as the governing body may prescribe, and that unless such paving be completed on or before a day specified in the resolution, the governing body will cause the same to be done. Where such railroad company shall occupy such street or streets under a franchise or contract which otherwise provides, such franchise or contract shall not be affected by this Section, except insofar as may be consistent with the provisions of such franchise or contract. -5 If the improvement directed to be made includes the construction of water mains or sewers, and in order to provide the mains and sewers in the street or streets to be improved it is necessary to extend them beyond the limits of the street or streets, the resolution shall contain a provision for the necessary extension of such mains or sewers and a further provision that the cost of such extension shall eventually be assessed against the lots or parcels of land abutting the street or streets in which such extensions are made but that assessments shall not be made until such time as the Council shall thereafter determine by appropriate resolution. -6 If the improvement directed to be made is the paving of a roadway or part thereof, or the construction of sidewalks, the resolution may, but need not, contain a direction that the owner of each lot abutting the part of the street to be improved, connect his lot by means of laterals with water mains, gas or sewer pipes, or any one or more thereof, located in the street adjacent to his premises in accordance with the requirements governing the laying of laterals, and that unless the owners cause laterals to be laid on or before a date specified in the resolution, the date to be not less than thirty days after the date of the resolution, the Council will cause the same to be laid. -7 A designation of the proportion of the cost of the improvements to be assessed against abutting property, and of the number of equal annual installments in which assessments may be paid. (b) The resolution after its passage shall be published at least once in some newspaper published in the City which is qualified to carry legal notices, or, if there is no such newspaper, the resolution shall be posted in three public places in the City for at least five days; except, that in any case where the Council directed that the notice should be served or mailed instead of being published, the resolution ordering the improvements need not be either published or posted. Section 12 DETAILS OF CONSTRUCTION: CONTRACTS FOR CONSTRUCTION: The Council shall have power to determine the character and type of construction and of material to be used and to determine any other details of plan or construction necessary to be determined in making any local improvements and to determine whether any work to be done by the City shall be done by contract or by the City. The Council shall have power also, unless otherwise limited, to determine the number of water, sewer and gas laterals that shall be laid to any lot on any street to be improved. If the work or any part thereof is to be done by contract, 193 the Council may let all of the work in one contract, or it may divide it into several contracts, and may let contracts separately. Section 13 DETERMINATION AS TO COST OF IMPROVEMENTS: Upon completion of the improvements, the Council shall ascertain the total cost. In addition to other items of cost, there may be included therein the cost of all necessary legal services, the amount of interest paid during construction, the amount of damages paid or to be paid for injury to property by reason of any change of grade or drainage, including court costs and other expenses incidental to the determination of damages, and the cost of retaining walls, sidewalks or fences built or altered in lieu of cash payment for property damage, including the cost of moving or altering any building. The determination of the Council as to the total cost of any improvement shall be conclusive. Section 14 PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT: (a) Having determined the total cost, the Council shall make a preliminary assessment. The preliminary assessment shall be advisory only and shall be subject to modification. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this Section, the preliminary assessment shall be as follows: -1 Roadway paving: The total cost of any roadway paving improvement, excluding the cost incurred at street intersections, shall be specifically assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting the street containing the roadway paved, according to the frontages thereon, by an equal rate per foot of frontage, except that, where the petition so requested, the cost shall be assessed against the lands on one side of the street only or against such lands as were designated in the petition. -2 Water mains and sewers: The cost of not exceeding an eight-inch water or sanitary sewer main and of not exceeding a thirty-inch storm sewer main shall be assessed against the abutting property. Such cost shall be assessed against the lots and parcels of land according to their respective frontages thereon by an equal rate per foot of such frontage. If a water or sanitary sewer main in excess of eight inches in size or a storm sewer in excess of thirty inches in size is laid, the excess cost shall be borne by the City. If the resolution ordered the construction of any pumping station, outfall, septic tank or disposal plant, no part of the cost of the same shall be specially assessed. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit the power of the Council to contract with any property owner or owners for the construction of any pumping station, outfall, septic tank or disposal plant or for the construction of water mains or storm or sanitary sewers and for the assessment of the cost thereof according to the terms of such contract. The entire cost of each water and sewer lateral shall be specially charged against the particular lot or parcel of land for or in connection with which it was constructed, except that the assessments shall be calculated as if the lateral were laid from the center of the street. The cost of installing storm sewers may, however, be assessed as part of the cost of roadway paving. -3 Sidewalks: The total cost of constructing or reconstructing sidewalks shall be assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting that 194 side of the street upon which the improvement is made according to their respective frontages thereon by an equal rate per foot of such frontage, the lots within a block being deemed to abut upon a sidewalk although the latter extends beyond the lot to the curb line of an intersecting street. The total cost of constructing portions of driveways within the street area shall be assessed against the lots for which they are constructed. -4 Grass Plots: The entire cost of grading or otherwise improving or of planting the grass plots in any street or part thereof shall be assessed against the lots and parcels of land abutting the street or part thereof where or whereon the improvements are made by an equal rate per front foot of such frontage; provided, that this subsection shall be construed to mean that when a grass plot in any street is graded or planted or otherwise improved, the cost thereof shall be assessed against all of the property abutting the street within the block where such grass plot is located. (b) If the petition (or the resolution in those cases where the improvement was ordered made without petition) specified that there should be specially assessed against the abutting property a smaller proportion of the cost of any improvement than that set forth in subsection (2), there shall be assessed against abutting property only the proportion of the cost as was specified in the petition or in said resolution. No restriction or denial of access to an abutting street shall affect the levy or collection of any assessment for local improvements. (c) The cost of paving, water, sewer, and sidewalk improvements upon, in, or to any portion of a right-of-way or any property owned by the State of North Carolina, any agency or subdivision thereof, shall be assessed against the right-of-way or property and shall be paid by the State, its agency or subdivision. Section 15 CORNER LOT EXEMPTIONS: The Council shall have authority to determine the amount and applicability of assessment exemptions for corner lots, and to distinguish between different classifications of property uses. The exemptions for paving sidewalk, and storm sewer improvements shall not exceed sixty feet and shall be limited to residential uses, and the exemptions for water mains and sanitary sewers shall not exceed one hundred and fifty feet for residential uses and one hundred feet for business uses. If the corner formed by two intersecting streets is rounded into a curve or is foreshortened for the purpose of providing sight distance or for any other purpose of construction, the frontage for assessment purposes shall be calculated to the midpoint of the curve or foreshortened corner. Section 16 PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT ROLL: The Council shall cause to be prepared a preliminary assessment roll, on which shall be entered a brief description of each lot or parcel of land assessed, the amount assessed against each lot, the name or names of the owner or owners of each lot, as far as the same can be ascertained; provided, that a map of the improvements on which is shown the frontage and location of each affected lot, together with the amount assessed against each lot and the name or names of the owner or owners thereof, as far as the same can be ascertained, shall be a sufficient assessment roll. If the resolu- 195 tion directed the making of more than one improvement, a single preliminary assessment roll for all the improvements authorized by such resolution shall be sufficient, but the cost of each improvement to each lot affected shall be shown separately. After the preliminary assessment roll has been completed, it shall be filed in the. office of the City Clerk, and there shall be published in some newspaper published in the City which is qualified to carry legal notices, or if there be no such newspaper, the City Clerk shall cause to be posted in three public places in the City, a notice of the completion of the assessment roll, setting forth a description in general terms of the improvements, the amount of each assessment, and stating the time fixed for the meeting of the Council for the hearing of objections to the special assessments, such meeting to be not earlier than ten days after the first publication or from the date of posting of said notice. Any number of assessment rolls may be included in one notice. In any case where the preliminary notice was served or mailed instead of being published, this notice need not be published or posted but may be served or mailed. The serving or mailing of notices shall be completed not less than five days prior to the date fixed for the hearing of the assessment roll, and the return of the person serving or mailing the same shall in the absence of fraud by conclusion that the same were served or mailed. Section 17 HEARING; REVISION; CONFIRMATION: LIEN: At the time appointed for that purpose or at some other time to which it may adjourn, the Council shall hear objections to the preliminary assessment roll of all persons interested who may appear and offer proof in relation thereto. Then or thereafter, the Council shall either annul or sustain or modify in whole or in part the assessment, either by confirming the preliminary assessment, against any or all lots or parcels described thereon, or by cancelling, increasing or reducing the same, according to the special benefits which the Council decides each of the lots or parels has received or will receive on account of the improvements, except that assessments against railroads because of contract or franchise obligations shall be in accordance with such obligations. If any property is omitted, from the preliminary roll, the Council may place it on the roll and levy the proper assessment. The Council may thereupon confirm the assessment roll, and the assessments so confirmed shall be in proportion to the special benefits, except in the case of franchise obligations of railroads. Whenever the governing bodies shall confirm assessments for local improvements, the City Clerk shall enter on the Council minutes and on the assessment roll the date, hour, and minute of confirmation the assessments shall be a lien on the property assessed of the same nature and to the same extent as county and city taxes and-shall be superior to all other liens and encumbrances. After the assessment roll is confirmed a copy of the same shall be delivered to the City Tax Collector. Section 18 APPEAL TO SUPERIOR COURT: If the owner of, or any person interested in, any lot or parcel of land against which an assessment is made is dissatisfied with the amount of the assessment, he may, within ten days after the confirmation of the assessment roll, give written notice to the Council that he takes an appeal to the Superior Court of 196 Robeson County, in which case he shall within twenty days after the confirmation of the assessment roll serve on the Mayor or City Clerk a statement of facts upon which he bases his appeal. The appeal shall be tried as other actions at law. The remedy herein provided for any person dissatisfied with the amount of the assessment against any property of which he is the owner or in which he is interested shall be exclusive. Section 19 POWER TO CORRECT ERROR IN ASSESSMENT: If it shall appear after confirmation of any assessment roll that an error has been made, the City Clerk shall cause to be published one time in some newspaper published in the City, or if there be no such newspaper, the City Clerk shall cause to be posted at three public places in the City, a notice referring to the assessment roll in which the error was made, naming the owner or owners of the lot or parcel of land affected by the error, if the same can be ascertained, and naming the time and place fixed for a hearing by the Council for the correction of the error, such meeting not to be earlier than ten days from the publication or from the date of the posting of the notice. At the time fixed in the notice or at some subsequent time to which the Council may adjourn, the Council, after giving the owner or owners of the property affected and other persons interested therein an opportunity to be heard, may proceed to correct the error, and the assessment then made shall have the same force and effect as if it had originally been properly made. No notice and hearing shall be necessary if the correction does not increase an assessment against any property not owned by the City, or if all of the property owners affected by the correction waive notice in writing. Section 20 REASSESSMENT: The Council shall have the power, when in its judgment there is any irregularity, omission, error or lack of jurisdiction in any of the proceedings relating thereto, to set aside the whole of the local assessment made by it, and thereupon to make a reassessment. In such case there shall be included, as a part of the cost of the improvements involved, all interest paid or accrued on notes or certificates of indebtedness, or bonds issued by the City to pay the expenses of such improvement. The proceeding shall, as far as practicable, be in all respects as in the case of original assessments, and the reassessment shall have the same force as if it had originally been properly made. Section 21 PUBLICATION OF NOTICE OF CONFIRMATION OF ASSESSMENT ROLL: After the expiration of twenty days from the confirmation of the assessment roll, the City Clerk shall cause to be published one time in some newspaper published in the City which is qualified to carry legal notices, or, if there be no such newspaper, shall cause to be posted at three public places in the City, a notice of confirmation of the assessment roll, and that assessments may be paid at any time before the expiration of thirty days from the date of publication or posting of the notice, without interest from the date of confirmation of the assessment roll, but that if such assessment is not paid in full, within said time, all installments thereof shall bear interest at the rate of six per centum per annum from the date of confirmation of the assessment roll. Section 22 PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS IN CASH OR BY IN- 197 STALLMENTS: The property owner or railroad company assessed shall have the option of paying for improvements in cash or in not less than two or more than ten equal annual installments as may have been determined in the resolution ordering the improvements. If paid in installments, installments shall bear interest at the rate of six per centum per annum from the date of confirmation of the assessment roll. If any assessment is not paid in cash, the first installment with interest shall become due and payable thirty days after the publication or posting of the notice of confirmation, and one subsequent installment and interest shall be due and payable on the same day of the month in each successive year until the assessment is paid in full; provided, however, that if the Council shall so direct installments shall become due and payable on the same date when property taxes of the City are due and payable. If any installment with interest is not paid when due, it shall be subject to the same penalties as are now prescribed by law for unpaid taxes, in addition to the interest herein provided for. The whole assessment may be paid at any time by the payment of full amount due with accrued interest. Section 23 ENFORCEMENT OF PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS: Upon the failure of any property owner to pay any installments when due and payable, all of the installments remaining unpaid shall immediately become due and payable, and property and rights-of-way may be sold by the City under the same rules, regulations, rights of redemption and savings as are now prescribed by law for the sale of land for unpaid taxes. Unpaid assessments, interest, and penalties owed by railroad companies and the State of North Carolina, its agencies or subdivisions, may be collected by writs of mandamus issued by the Superior Court of Robeson County. Collection of assessments with interest and penalties may also be made by the City by proceedings to foreclose the lien of assessments as a lien for mortgages is or may be foreclosed under the laws of the State, and it shall be lawful to join in any bill for foreclosure any one or more lots or parcels of land, by whomsoever owned, if assessed for an improvement ordered by the same resolution, after default in the payment of any installment. The payment of said installment, together with interest and penalties due thereon, before the lot or parcel of land, against which the same is a lien is sold or said lien is foreclosed shall bar the right of the City to sell land or to foreclose the lien by reason of default. Section 24 ASSESSMENT OF COST OF WATER MAIN AND SEWER EXTENSIONS: If the resolution ordering the making of any improvement or improvements included a provision for any necessary extension of a water main or sewer or sewers beyond the limit of a street or streets, at such time after the completion of said extension or extensions as, in the judgment of the Council, circumstances justify the assessment of the cost thereof, the Council shall cause a preliminary assessment to be made and the procedure thereafter to be followed with respect to such assessment and the force and effect thereof shall be as already prescribed for other assessments. Section 25 APPORTIONMENT OF ASSESSMENTS: In any case where one or more special assessments have been made, and property has 198 been, or is about to be, subdivided, and it is desirable that the assessments be apportioned among the subdivisions of such property, the Council may, upon application by the owner or owners, apportion the assessments among the subdivisions. Thereafter, each subdivision shall be relieved of any part of the original assessment except the part apportioned to the subdivision, and the part of the original assessment apportioned to any subdivision shall be of the same force and effect as the original assessment. Section 26 CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP: No change of ownership of any property or interest therein after the passage of a resolution ordering the making of a local improvement shall affect subsequent proceedings, and the improvements may be completed and assessment made therefor as if there had been no change in ownership. Section 27 LANDS SUBJECT TO ASSESSMENT: No lands in the City, including railroad company lands and rights-of-way and property of the State of North Carolina, its agencies or subdivisions shall be exempt from special assessments except lands belonging to the United States which are exempt under the provisions of Federal Statutes, and the Council and the officers, trustees or boards of all incorporated or unincorporated bodies in whom is vested the right to hold and dispose of real property shall have the right by authority duly given to sign the petition for any local improvements. Section 28 PROCEEDINGS IN REM: All proceedings for special assessments shall be proceedings in rem, and no mistake or omission as to the name of any owner or person interested in any lot or parcel of land affected thereby shall be regarded as a substantial mistake or omission. Section 29 GRASS PLOT AND DRIVEWAY MAINTENANCE: It shall be the responsibility of the abutting property owner to maintain any grass plot or driveway between the property line and the curb of a paved street. Section 30 COUNCIL MAY HOLD IN ABEYANCE CERTAIN WATER AND SEWER ASSESSMENTS: (a) The City Council may provide by resolution that assessments levied against abutting lots or parcels of land for water main improvements or sanitary sewer improvements, when in its opinion such improvements may not presently be used by the owners of the abutting lots or parcels of land, may be held in abeyance without the payment of any interest thereon until such time as the Council shall determine that any such assessments shall be paid in accordance with the terms set out in the confirming resolution. A part of the assessments levied for the improvements herein set out on a street or streets, or portion thereof, may be held in abeyance as herein provided without holding all of said assessments in abeyance. (b) All statutes of limitations, and particularly the statute of limitations provided for in Chapter 331, Section 1, of Public Laws 1929 (G. S. 160-93) are hereby suspended during the time that any assessment is held in abeyance without the payment of interest, as provided in subsection (a). Such time shall not be a part of the time limited for the commencement of action for the enforcement of the payment of any such assessment, and such action may be brought at any time within ten years from te date 199 of the adoption of a resolution by the Council, determining that such assessment shall be paid in accordance with the original resolution confirming it. (c) Nothing herein shall be construed to revive any right of action which has heretofore been barred. by the statute of limitations. Section 31 ABUTTING PROPERTY OUTSIDE CITY LIMITS: If any lots or parcels of land abutting any local improvements are located outside the City limits, the Council may continue and delay the levy of assessments against such property, until the City limits are extended to include such property, or the Council may provide that no water or sewer service connections shall be made to such property, pending the annexation thereof, until all assessments thereon are paid. Upon annexation, if not paid prior thereto, the Council may levy assessments for such local improvements against such property, and the procedure therefor shall be the same as provided in the Charter. Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to prohibit or restrict the City Council and a property owner from entering into an agreement for payments in lieu of assessments. ARTICLE XIV. MISCELLANEOUS Section 1 CLAIMS AGAINST THE CITY: (a) Presentation of Claims to City Council: No action shall be instituted against the City of Lumberton upon any claim or demand whatever of any kind or character until the claimant shall have first presented in writing his or her claim or demand to the City Council and the Council shall have declined to pay or settle the same as presented, or for sixty days after presentation shall have neglected to enter or cause to be entered upon its minutes its determination in regard thereto. Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed to prevent any statute of limitations from commencing to run at the time when a claim accrued or demand arose, or in any manner to interfere with its running. (b) Time for Presentation of Claims: 1 Except as otherwise provided in this Section, no action for damages of any character whatever, to either person or property, shall be instituted against the City unless, within six months after the happening or infliction of the injury complained of, the complainant, his executor, administrator, guardian, or next friend shall have given notice in writing to the Council of the injury, stating in the notice the date and place of the injury, the manner of infliction, the character of the injury, and the amount of damage claimed. 2 No action shall be instituted against the City on account of damages to or compensation for real property used or taken by the City for any public purpose of any kind unless within two years after such alleged use, the owner, his executor, administrator, guardian, or next friend shall have given notice in writing to the Council of the claim, the notice to set forth the date that the alleged use commenced, a description of the property alleged to have been used, and the amount of damage or compensation claimed. 200 3 Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections 1 and 2 of this Section, if a complainant suffers from physical or mental incapacity that renders it impossible for him to give notice, his action shall not be barred if notice of claim is given by him or on his behalf within six months after the termination of the physical or mental incapacity, provided that minority shall not of itself constitute physical or mental incapacity. If the complainant is a minor, his action shall not be barred if notice of claim is given on his behalf within three years after the happening or the infliction of the injury complained of; or, if the minor suffers from physical or mental incapacity that renders it impossible for him to give notice, his action shall not be barred if notice of claim is given on his behalf within six months after termina on of the physical or mental incapacity, or within three years after the happening or infliction of the injury complained of, whichever is the longer period. The City at any time may request the appointment of a next friend to represent any person having a potential claim against the City and known to be suffering from physical and mental incapacity.
