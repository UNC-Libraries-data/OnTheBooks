    "We've already discussed this in the [last module](03-WhatIsOCR.ipynb), but it bears repeating. In order to perform OCR on a text corpus, we need the following:\n",

    "- A **single file folder** containing all of the corpus files. If the corpus is small enough (e.g. 1 book), this could be simply a single file.\n",

    "**Producing OCR'ed text is an iterative, rather than a linear, process.** To get the best possible output involves multiple steps and in some instances repetition of steps. Here's an overview of what these steps can look like. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Keep in mind that this process can vary not only based on the complexity and legibility of your corpus but also based on the resources you have. Consider your expertise, whether you are working with a team or by yourself, how much time you have, and your ultimate research goal. These should all factor in to how complex you make your OCR process.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-Processing:\n",
    "This phase is all about testing to figure out the best adjustments and OCR settings for your corpus:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a folder of sample text from your corpus.** The size of the sample may depend on the corpus' size and homogeneity or heterogeneity, but it should be an amount that you and/or your team could review manually in a reasonably short period of time.\n",
    "2. **Run OCR on your sample.**\n",
    "3. **Review the output** to identify errors, **looking especially for error *patterns*** that could be addressed at a corpus level.\n",
    "4. **Create a list of errors and [possible adjustments](#pre-processing)** that you might use to address the errors. **Order the list based on which errors should be solved first--which might address the largest number of errors.** For example, it would be more important to fix rotated or skewed pages across the sample/corpus before trying to use erosion or dilation to make specific pages more legible to Tesseract. \n",
    "5. **Make the first adjustment** on your list to the sample.\n",
    "6. **Re-run OCR on your sample.**\n",
    "7. **Review the output.** Has the output improved noticeably? Are there still errors and error patterns? \n",
    "8. **Repeat some or all of the above steps:** Depending on your findings, you might continue applying adjustments from your list, re-running OCR, and reviewing outputs, or you might be ready to move on to the next step. \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the *complexity* of your corpus, you may want to select a few different samples to complete this process with and then compare the adjustments you make across all samples to see which adjustments work best overall, and which might *introduce* errors to certain parts of the corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "If need be, you could consider running OCR on separate parts of your corpus. The *On The Books* team did this because marginalia (text printed in the margins) appear through a significant portion of the corpus but are no longer printed after a certain point. Removing marginalia wasn't necessary once it stopped appearing in the text, so that step could be skipped for the later portion of texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performing OCR:\n",
    "Once you're satisfied with the pre-processing on your sample(s), here's where you run the actual OCR. This part of the process may also be iterative:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Apply your chosen pre-processing adjustments** to your entire corpus.\n",
    "2. **Run OCR** on your entire corpus.\n",
    "3. **Pull samples from your output to review.** Do you notice any recurring or new errors? If so, you may need to return to pre-processing to assess and address these errors.\n",
    "4. **Repeat steps 1-3 as needed.** If you have a very large corpus, you may consider running these steps in batches and iterating through each batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Cleaning\" OCR:\n",
    "**This part of the process is often best performed with a combination of manual (human) and automated (computer) steps.** This is where you may be addressing not only errors in the OCR itself but also issues with the original printing, as we describe below with regard to [hyphenated words at the end of lines](#hyphens). As with pre-processing, how complex you make iterations in this phase depends on your corpus and your resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Python to check for and correct possible spelling errors.** This step should focus on common words and avoid proper nouns. As with any automated step, it's possible that new errors will be introduced here. \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. If there is a known and small quantity of proper nouns used in individual texts or across the corpus, and these are consistently \"read\" incorrectly by Tesseract, it may be possible to use Python to correct these.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. If your corpus is small enough and/or you have a team that can help you, **read through the corpus** to manually check for and correct errors. This may be a moment to correct proper nouns. If you have a team, it may be advisable to have texts read and corrected by multiple team members. It will be important that these team members have access to both inputs and outputs, and perhaps even lists of proper nouns, to be able to compare the original scans with the computer-readable versions. You may even want to set up a process whereby reviewers can flag words they are not sure about so that another reviewer can provide their opinion so that you and/or another project manager making a final decision on uncertain words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above process could be broken down further to address smaller issues incrementally and iteratively. It may also be useful to break your corpus into units of analysis before or during this process to assist with cleaning. We will discuss the splitting process when we structure our OCR'ed data in the [next module](05-StructuringOCRData.ipynb)."

You may have noticed that the file name ends with `0057` rather than `0001`. This is because scanned session law volumes often include other content, such as a scan of the outer covers, a table of contents, and the North Carolina state constitution, appearing before or after the laws themselves. Because the *On The Books Team* is only interested in the laws themselves, we went through each volume and removed all images that we did't need. The lesson here: **don't run OCR on content that you don't need.** \n",

Use caution if you choose this route, though, as it can be hard to undo deletions performed programmatically. At the end of the day *you probably know better than your computer* which files you need and which you don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing pages? Duplicate pages?\n",
    "\n",
    "Something else to note about the 1955 laws in particular: The first two files in the scanned volume, ending `0000` and `0001`, happen to be scans of pages in the middle of the volume. These could be included at the beginning for a few reasons: \n",

    "\n",
    "Regardless of the reason, now is the right moment to **check whether these pages were indeed skipped** and make a note of this so that you can be sure they are included in the OCR and final dataset. As it happens, these pages were *not* skipped but were duplicates, so we would remove them. If you *don't* find pages like these out of order in your own corpus, either indicated by page numbers in the images themselves or by numbered file names skipping an integer, *it may not be worth your time to check every page* (particularly if you are dealing with thousands of pages). It's possible to identify skipped pages in the data structuring process and add them to the larger dataset. \n",

    "**The higher quality the digitization, the better the OCR**--this is the general rule. \"Quality\" has a lot to do with the OCR requirements we've already covered as well as those we'll cover below. We can begin, though, with the number of pixels per image--that is, the number of pixels per *inch*. Remember that computers present images as a grid of pixels, usually squares but sometimes rectangles, and that each carry specific color information. Put hundreds, thousands, millions of pixels together, and we have an image. \n",

If you've ever opened a webpage and seen text but had to wait a few seconds for images to load, you've seen the difference between how long it takes for text vs. an image to load. The more pixels, the larger the file (in kilobytes, megabytes, or even gigabytes), and large files take longer to move from a server to your computer--add in low bandwidth internet, and the load time increases exponentially. \n",

    "\n",
    "While Tesseract does have tools for estimating a document's orientation, on its own it is not wel equipped to identify text order, recognize images, or understand arrangement of text and images on a page--tasks that many refer to as [\"document layout analysis\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_layout_analysis) or \"page layout analysis.\" These analysese need to be performed before running Tesseract in order to proide it with th ecorrect ordering and layout information--or, rather, in order to focus its attention on specific parts of a document in a specific sequence. Here is an overview of that workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the areas on a page that you want Tesseract to focus on. It may be that you want to include only *some* parts of a page and not others. Consider whether this area might be similar or different on different documents.\n",

Source: Chronicling America\" title=\"Newspaper page showing text in two columns with a vertical line separating them and an image in the middle of the right column. Source: Chronicling America\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each page, calculate the area that you want to *include* in the OCR. To do this, use pixels as cartesian/XY coordinates to mark out an area's corners. The outlines created by these coordinates are referred to as \"bounding boxes\" and may include as much or as little text as needed. This may be automated in a variety of ways using Python but may need some human intervention.\n",

Each column is annotated with a pink bounding box to indicate specific, separate areas of text. Source: Chronicling America\" />\n",
    "\n",

    "3. Create a dataset of all of the bounding boxes on each page. To do this, you may need to specify particular features about the document, such as whether columns are separated by a vertical line or blank space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Feed these bounding boxes and the content within them in their \"reading\" order to Tesseract for OCRing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is [an example of how *On The Books* did this to exclude marginalia from its OCR](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries-data/OnTheBooks/blob/master/examples/marginalia_determination/marginalia_determination.ipynb).\n",

    "There ar a variety of tools you might use to do this. *On The Books* used [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) Python libraries. [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)'s computer vision tools can also be used for this as can tools such as [Kraken](http://kraken.re/) and [OCRopus](https://ocropus.github.io/).

So the spellcheck process is only as good as the information we provide. If you are working with text that includes abbreviations, non-English words, words written in dialect, or words that are in any other way not \"standard,\" it's important to include them. This may mean taking time to put together a list of words to add to the spellchecker. In some cases, though, this may not be practical--particularly for texts with a lot of dialog written in dialect, or for non-standard spellings. In these cases, you may need to check spellings manually.

Furthermore, the alternating upper and lowercase characters in `session` were ignored because we changed all words to lowercase for the spellcheck.
