    "- <strong><mark style=\"background-color:lightgreen\">word frequency</mark></strong>: Counting the number of times a word appears in a corpus. A common goal with this method is to identify popular or frequently appearing words and possible patterns in their usage.\n",
    "- **collocation**: Counting occurrences of 2 or more words appearing near one another. Collocation can be used to identify possible relationships between the appearance of different words close together in a corpus.\n",
    "- <strong><mark style=\"background-color:lightgreen\">**n-grams**</mark></strong>: Counting the appearance of 2+ word phrases. As with word frequency, a common goal is to identify frequently occurring phrases and possible patterns in their usage.\n",
    "- <strong><mark style=\"background-color:lightgreen\">concordance</mark></strong>: Viewing the context(s) in which a word appears.\n",
    "- **entity recognition**: Identifying names, places, etc.\n",
    "- **dictionary tagging**: Looking for specific words within a text.\n",
    "- **topic modeling**: Grouping texts in a corpus together based on the presence of specific terms. The aim with topic modeling is to create semantically meaningful groups and to look for patterns in those groupings.\n",

(Although not written on this page, this information is publicly available on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_North_Carolina_state_legislatures) and can also be found in the first and last chapters of the volume.) To answer our current question, do we need to assign the laws from volumes such as 1874/75 to a single year? If our aim is to show the number of laws per year, and sessions overlapping multiple years were begun *late* in the first year (e.g. November 1874), then one option would be to choose the latter year, 1875 in this case. This choice would align with the printer's year on the volume's title page, and it would cover all laws passed from November 1874 until the end of session in 1875. Whereas at the start of the 1874 session, none of the laws in the volume had been passed. The choice would also align with historic patterns for holding legislative sessions, which are described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote><p>Legislative sessions generally began in November of odd years until 1875, when the opening day shifted to the first Wednesday after the first Monday in January after an election. From 1957 to 1967 sessions were convened in February, but since 1967 they have begun in January. A 1989 law specifies that the General Assembly convenes at noon on \"the third Wednesday after the second Monday in January after the election.\" From the eighteenth century until well into the twentieth, the \"long\" sessions held in odd years generally lasted from one to three months, depending on the amount of business pending. In recent years, sessions have lasted for six or seven months. The General Assembly now also holds a \"short session\" in even-numbered years to adjust the budget and deal with other necessary matters.</p>\n",
    "    <p>~ Norris, David A. \"General Assembly.\" <em>NCPedia.</em> 2006. Accessed April 2, 2021. <a href=\"https://www.ncpedia.org/general-assembly\" target=\"blank\">https://www.ncpedia.org/general-assembly</a>.</p></blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can assume that most sessions were held, or finished, in an odd year. Those that were held or finished in an even year were most likely special sessions. We'll opt to label all volume years formatted as \"1874/75\" by the latter year, in this case 1875.

So any laws passed prior to 1881 that would have pertained to the area now known as Durham County will be classified as belonging to Orange or Wake Counties respectively. Further research on those laws and if/how they would have applied to Durham County would need to be done in order to create a more historically accurate spatial dataset. \n",

Therefore, in our new dataframe, a laws pertaining to multiple counties will be replicated to account for each county listed. This, the section associated with `CHAPTER 330` above will appear once with `Nash` in a new `CountyName` column and once with `Edgecome` in the `CountyName` column. We want to avoid introducing this duplication into our main Jim Crow laws dataframe, which is why we are working in a separate dataframe.\n",

We've used `bbox` to add a small box around the text that helps contrast it with its county color. The color (`facecolor`) can be changed as can the opacity (`alpha`). `alpha` needs a value between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive). `pad` specifies how large the box is around the text. `edgecolor` gives the box an outline, or as in this case `none`.\n",
