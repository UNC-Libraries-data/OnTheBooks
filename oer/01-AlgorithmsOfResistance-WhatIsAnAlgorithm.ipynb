    "Awareness and representation are only the beginning of working against such oppression, however. Let’s go back to the definition of algorithms provided by Benjamin: “a set of instructions, rules, and calculations _designed_ to solve problems.” (6) Algorithms and how they are used to construct platforms, perform analyses, and make decisions are created _by design_. Someone somewhere defined a goal they needed a computer’s help to meet, outlined steps and rules that computers could use to achieve the goal, and wrote the code to carry out those steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we use design theory and ethics to think about how we create and use algorithms? Sasha Costanza-Chock has considered this question from the design perspective in their 2020 book,[ Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need](https://design-justice.pubpub.org/). Joy Buolamwini and the[ Algorithmic Justice League](https://www.ajl.org/), of which Costanza-Chock is a member, are thinking through and carrying out resistance to algorithmic oppression through their focus on exposing and eliminating biased and harmful AI technologies. They work against what Ruha Benjamin has termed “discriminatory design.” **We draw from their examples to outline here a set of acknowledgments and guidelines for creating and working with algorithms of resistance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   First, even as we seek to create and use algorithms to enact common good, _we must acknowledge that we live in a society whose foundation is racist, sexist, capitalist, and colonialist and that nothing we create is neutral._\n",
    "*   This means that while we do not _intend_ to systematically exclude marginalized people, we recognize that _any algorithmic platform, analysis, or tool we create or use may still impose unintentional harm through unconscious bias, whether small or significant._\n",
    "*   In spite of these challenges, we seek to _use algorithms to resist discriminatory policies and to enact positive change_ by:\n",
    "    *   _Centering those whose knowledge and experiences directly connect to our work:_ Who are they? What kinds of cultural knowledge and experience do they have to share? How are they impacted by discriminatory policies? How could our work cause harm? How could our collaboration create a positive impact?\n",
    "    *   _Considering our own identities, assumptions, and privileges:_ Who are we? What kinds of assumptions and privileges do we bring to our work with algorithms? How might those assumptions and privileges cause harm? How can we address our assumptions, privileges, and their impacts through our work?\n",
    "    *   _Ensuring transparency in our uses and creation of algorithms:_ For the algorithms we use or create, we provide documentation to explain as clearly as possible what each algorithm does, how it does it, and how we are using it. To the extent possible, we choose existing algorithms based on their degree of transparency.\n",
    "    *   _Enabling community agency and control:_ The greatest form of agency is the power to design algorithms. Through education and community engagement, we make students, scholars, and the general public aware of our work and the ways that we are using algorithms with the aim of contributing to the growth of current and future, especially non-white, programmers. In addition to promoting awareness, we seek feedback on how our work with algorithms may be impacting others and how we can address that impact.\n",
    "    *   _Keeping humans in the loop:_ Our work is _not_ purely technical or algorithmic. We, the humans, decide which algorithms we use, how we use them, and when we work with other humans alongside or instead of computers.\n",
    "    *   _Prioritizing process over product:_ Getting the process right is key to using algorithms for resistance. We might create a product without considering any of the above guidelines, but we risk perpetrating far more harm than if we take the time to get the process—the algorithms—right.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same algorithm can be used for oppression or resistance. How we design and use algorithms, and how they impact those vulnerable to discriminatory policies, determines whether they _enact_ oppression or resistance. The question remains, as Costanza-Chock writes, “What will it take for us to transform the ways that we design technologies (sociotechnical systems) of all kinds, including digital interfaces, applications, platforms, algorithms, hardware, and infrastructure, to help us advance toward liberation?” (“Design Values”)"
